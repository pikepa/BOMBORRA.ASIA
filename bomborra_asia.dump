The real trick is getting in, getting out and not fouling up the job by getting yourself killed.</div><div>Success depends on common sense, solid equipment and most importantly your backup. For many a journalist and photographer in Cambodia Ly Kim-Song was that backup.</div><div>Mr Song, as he was known to everyone, died suddenly on Sunday, January 14, after a period of illness. He was 64.</div><div>Song was born in the southeastern province of Svay Rieng where he spent his formative years before moving to Phnom Penh. He graduated from Sisowath High School, married Tat Kim Huoy in 1966 and they had three sons, two daughters and seven grandchildren.</div><div>In those early years, his family totally depended on Song in a part of the world that was being engulfed by war. An ethnic Vietnamese with a distaste for communists, he feared the Khmer Rouge far more than the Viet Cong or North Vietnamese and in 1973 he booked the flights and took his family to Saigon.</div><div>There he worked in a soft drink factory, raising his children as the world around him descended into chaos. South Vietnam was consumed by the North, as his cherished homeland — Cambodia — was devastated by Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge and then Hanoi invaded, which would occupy it for a decade marked by vicious fighting.</div><div>While Song, like too many other Cambodians, never attended university, his intellect was formidable. He was fluent in six languages plus some Russian. His French was parfait and this soon came to the attention of the communist authorities in Saigon who were eager to employ him. But he loathed the thuggery which had accompanied communist rule and decided he would rather pedal a cyclo than join the ruling elite.</div><div>In 1983 he returned to his homeland and did just that for the next eight years until he chanced upon Sheri Prasso, the first bureau chief for Agence France-Presse (AFP) since before Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge.</div><div>Mr Song was swiftly employed in 1991, becoming the backbone of the AFP operation, and alongside Cambodian journalist Reach Sambath forged a formidable team that enabled seven bureau chiefs, dozens of journalists and photographers and hundreds of others who drifted through the office looking for help — to cover a terrific, if often troubled, country.</div><div>Diminutive in stature — he described himself as “svelte and sexy” — Song worked his heart out. He translated, spotted errors in news stories, controlled the accounts, sorted satellite dishes and phone lines, massaged egos, launched and nursed many a hangover, dealt with belligerent authorities and dilettante journalists, and knew who could be counted on and who could not.</div><div>He once hugged me, shoved 5,000 dollars in my pocket and said bon courage. Then I left for Iraq. He hugged me again when I returned then asked for the receipts. He said “war is not good” then fetched a lot of cold beer.</div><div>Song rarely, if ever, criticised others but would cringe and could hardly contain himself when Cambodian politicians delivered vitriolic anti-Vietnamese diatribes to score cheap political points, particularly in the lead-up to elections.</div><div>Song would calm quickly but his words carried a greater sting: “Look at this country, they have learned nothing.” At barbecues and parties I more than once saw Song control an assortment of diplomats, Khmer Rouge experts, academics and journalists with the learned wit of an honest man who was the equal of any.</div><div>Adults would sit cross legged on the floor, like children being entertained by a fairy tale, as he sat in a chair and satisfied their curiosity about Cambodia past and present. Cambodia is too often criticised for lacking strong characters with an integrity to match.</div><div>When I felt like that, I only had to look at Mr Song to feel sorry that such a thought had entered my head. AFP’s Cambodian correspondent Suy Se said it simply: ” We are sad by the sudden loss of Mr Song, a great personality.”</div>',1,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Ly Kim-Song; A Great Journalistic Backbone: 1943-2007 From Luke Hunt PHNOM PENH &#8212;&nbsp;Any idiot can cover a firefight, it has often been said among journalists.

Sitting alone, he stared into his Angkor beer while the sun sank against the Tonle Sap River outside.</div><div>Just last summer, as AK-47’s rattled nearby, the club was packed. Reporters from around the world had descended upon Phnom Penh to cover Cambodia’s latest war, a short-lived affair that smashed a short-lived coalition government. With the action came the out-of-town professionals.</div><div>“Yeah, it was wall to wall then,” said club manager Tony Anderson. “But if you watched or read anything they were reporting, you’d have thought there was fighting on every corner. That simply wasn’t the case. If you really wanted to know what the hell was going on, you needed to talk with the reporters based here.”</div><div>The reporters based here, the ones Anderson admires, are a new breed of foreign correspondent – the freelancer. Phnom Penh’s full of them; part-time writers, photographers and hangers on, all working against the odds. They defy media budget cuts and a reduced demand for international news by sticking around to cover everyday Cambodia.</div><div>They are a mix of saints and sinners; some write truth and tragedy, others get blown-up playing war alongside guerrilla troops and some simply enjoy the cheap pot and sex – for US$20 you can get sky high with a hooker until sunrise. But the real attraction is the opportunity: Cambodia is cheap, full of stories, and too dangerous for most. “All you need to get here is a backpack and some dreams,” said one reporter.</div><div>One dream universally pursued here finally ended two weeks ago with the death of Pol Pot.&nbsp; A madman of staggering proportion, Pol Pot ran the Khmer Rouge and ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, leaving an estimated 2 million people dead in his wake. He spent the next two decades hiding in the country’s impenetrable northern jungles.</div><div>The man was the ultimate savage riddle – who really was he, where was he, and why had he killed so many fellow countrymen, babies…pregnant mothers?&nbsp; Freelancers seeking to solve the puzzle and remind the world of the tragedy he left behind, started trickling into Cambodia during the late 1980s when the country began to stabilize (it still receives the US State Department’s highest grade travel advisory).</div><div>Kicking around Phnom Penh and Bangkok, a base for many reporters covering Cambodia, it’s a pleasant surprise to find a number have Massachusetts links; the State House, the combat zone (when there was one), appreciation for the Boston Herald’s Howie Carr, etc. etc.</div><div>In fact, it was a Bostonian, Nate Thayer, who nearly solved the riddle last year, when he the scored an exclusive interview with Pol Pot. Considered the decade’s biggest international scoop and the last major interview in Asia, Thayer’s meeting was Pol Pot’s first with an outsider in 18 years and ended up being the last. “Look at me, am I a savage? My conscience is clear,” the dying 72-year-old told Thayer last October.</div><div>Thayer’s stories forced world leaders to finally consider trying the murderer before international courts for crimes against humanity. A week before Pol Pot’s death, Bill Clinton even admitted serious interest in the issue. Now, it’s too late.</div><div>Thayer hunted 10-years for the story. During the quest, he trekked 700 kilometers of jungle, was hospitalized 16 times with cerebral malaria, suffered land mine injuries, and led a now mythical hunt for Cambodia’s bizarre endangered cow – the Kupray. Thayer once finagled $478 out of the Associated Press for gin and tonics. “Medical reasons,” he said with a laugh. “You know, tonic contains anti-malarial agents.”</div><div>He split UMASS Boston in 1988. “I looked at my life – school, a job and a fiancée from hell – and decided it was all wrong…it was fucking boring.” Thayer scraped by month-to-month, working for Soldier of Fortune magazine and the AP before freelancing for the Far Eastern Economic Review weekly magazine. For the Review, Thayer linked Cambodia’s key political figures to Southeast Asia’s massive heroin trade, and uncovered the last army still fighting the Vietnam War. “I was the first white guy they’d seen in 17 years,” he said. “When I showed up the head of the tribe asked, ‘where are our guns?\'”</div><div>People here say Thayer’s an inspiration. His Pol Pot story took 10 years of grunt work, an impossibility for reporters who drop into Cambodia only when it’s on the verge of war. Others here have put in their time, like international freelancer and cameraman David McKaige, who accompanied Thayer on his Pol Pot interview.</div><div>In the past decade, the fierce eyed 32-year-old McKaige has worked in Bosnia, Africa, Sri-Lanka and other war-torn regions. “I’ll admit it –&nbsp; I’ve been numbed by some of what I’ve seen,” he said, commenting on the height of the Balkan War. “You’d walk into a village and see a young girl who’d just been gang raped an hour earlier, send out the story, and no-one in the world gave a shit. That was hard.”</div><div>McKaige stuffed his backpack at the end of his freshman year at Boston College and started hacking through the Cambodia/Thai border freelancing for CBS. These days, he runs AsiaWorks in Bangkok, supplying Southeast Asian news footage to media organizations across the world. McKaige’s work is an uphill battle. Budget cuts by America’s networks (CBS, NBC and ABC), have reduced regional coverage and expertise. “Tokyo bureaus now cover all of Asia,” he said.</div><div>Some wire services have also cut budgets, killing coveted “ex-pat packages,” that allowed reporters to live abroad in comfort. Reuters, the British news wire, began acing expat deals in the early 1990s. “Reuters beancounters heralded the death of the ex-pat package,” said <a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/story-board/luke-hunt/\">Luke Hunt</a>, a quick-witted Australian correspondent based in Hong Kong. “Locals have begun writing what outsiders, who knew their home audiences, once covered.”</div><div>On some level this works, as the focus of international news since the Cold War’s end has shifted from politics to business. America and it’s allies no longer fight the Soviet Union to contain communism, but instead wrangle with local leaders to open markets to capitalism. The new weapons are trade agreements and stock markets and news from these battlegrounds doesn’t require the same world-view as coverage of America’s military situation in Asia.</div><div>But many here say it’s gone to far, leaving big picture stories by the wayside. McKaige pointed to Reuters, located beneath his AsiaWorks studio, as an example. There, in an office of 25 employees, 23 work on financial news and corporate sales, while two reporters cover general news. “In Asia these days – it’s all fucking business,” McKaige said.</div><div>Thayer believes everyone, including corporate types, want to know more.&nbsp; According to the Review’s sales figures for 1997, the two Pol Pot cover stories were last year’s best sellers. “It’s complete bullshit that business people are only interested in investment news,” Thayer said. “People everywhere want to know what the hell’s really going on in the world.”</div><div>An interesting point, but how does it apply to Cambodia now that Pol Pot’s gone?&nbsp; He was the evil head of a beastly story about a country utterly destroyed in a side-show to the Vietnam War. The country has no economic stories suited for the 1990s news climate, outside of gun and drug smuggling.&nbsp; Human interest news all but dried up when anti-land mine operatives won last year’s Noble Peace Prize.&nbsp; What’s left?</div><div>While pondering such cosmic issues, some correspondent’s fall back on the perverse image of the trade: heavy drink and obnoxious behavior. Take former Reuters correspondent Leo Dobbs who got fired after he called Cambodian Premier Hun Sen’s house at midnight and told Hun’s wife to “fuck off.”&nbsp; Dobb’s, who’s mighty thirst is known as far as Hong Kong, remembered nothing of the incident the following morning until a call came from Reuters rescinding his post.</div><div>“You get some crazy people down here,” said Michael Hayes, editor of the Phnom Penh Post, Cambodia’s leading English language paper. “Established journalists don’t want to live in a shithole like this, and that brings in the backpackers.”</div><div>Hayes, who arrived lacking journalism experience himself, said fresh blood can be a good thing.&nbsp; Since the Post’s first edition in 1992, he’s relied largely on a pool of freelance talent, led by Thayer, to put out a bi-weekly paper that’s tackled issues no one else will touch. “These guys are the lifeblood of reporting coming out of the third world these days,” he said.</div><div>Back at the Foreign Correspondents Club they know this. They’ll tell you Thayer may have been passed over for last year’s Pulitzer Prize earlier this month, but everyone knows it was his work that brought the tragedy of Cambodia back into the world’s headlines. Pol Pot may be dead, but his legacy lives – child soldiers, rocket launchers, jungle warfare…senseless death.&nbsp; Those stories will likely come from the freelancers.</div><div>Elections set for this summer should be bloody enough to attract the hordes of international press again, but like they say, if you want to know what’s going on, you have to talk to the people based here. “This place will fill up again soon,” said the reporter at the bar as the moon began to rise. “It’ll be bullshit, but that’s life in Cambodia.”</div>',1,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>As Britain handed its cherished Hong Kong back to China in 1997 and Cambodia endured a coup that would bring decades of civil war to an end, American journalist Dan Boylan filed the following.

The city is mostly shut down.

The means are comparably cruel and devious and aimed at controlling the coverage of an Iraqi invasion by weakening the media&#8217;s capabilities through boredom and bankruptcies.</p>\n<p>To explain it costs $5,000 to get a journalist here and kit them out in the latest battlefield colors. Throw in a $1,500 a month per car, a $3,000 a month per diem, another $5,000 for hotels, then multiply by 2,000 for the number of journalists who have swept though the desert capital, and it&#8217;s easy to comprehend the increased rate of heart attacks in the bean-counting department of news gathering offices around the world.</p>\n<p>The military has also hidden itself behind closed doors and adopted a &#8220;tell em nothing&#8221; stance since Colin Powell told the UN Security Council that, &#8220;there&#8217;s no doubt Saddam Hussein is a really bad boy but the war probably won&#8217;t start for another three or four weeks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Old Cambodia hand APTN cameraman producer Jerry Harmer said the conspiracy is &#8220;definitely happening&#8221; and will serve to whittle back its effectiveness of the media when the real push starts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just look at the press officers &#8212; they&#8217;re clearly imposters. One of them is called David Dismukes, and if that isn&#8217;t a made-up name then I don&#8217;t know what is,&#8221; he said referring to the men and women sporting the latest desert attire and assigned to ensure each journalist gets unfettered access to the biggest non-news event since Y2K.</p>\n<p>The Bangkok-based producer has spent nearly a month &#8216;in-country&#8217; passing time on the occasional military exercise in anticipation that real bullets may one day get fired.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The only bright spot is afternoon high tea at the Shjeraton Hotel where the milk is poured first and the tea follows, always at the correct temperature.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The US military insists that people covering war have to obey the rules of the &#8216;host country&#8217;. That means no booze and keep your eyes off the women.</p>\n<p>But the media pack has countered and engaged the illicit production facilities of a subversive Indian named Waqil, who for a few bucks can brew a poison that mixes well with orange juice and serves as a vague reminder of a drop of Stoly.</p>\n<p>Waqil reliably informs us that a simple test &#8212; light the fluid and make sure it burns blue &#8212; will ensure you won&#8217;t go blind and stumble across a minefield.

However it has thoroughly ticked-off others by moving Thursday&#8217;s media briefing &#8212; the two o&#8217;clock follies &#8212; out of the Sheraton Hotel and into the Hilton Hotel.</p>\n<p>Colonel Rick Thomas, who is not allowed to be quoted, declared the policy at his regular follies, Ricky&#8217;s friends said this type of embed assignment is unheard of since the D-Day Normandy Invasion of 1944, when reporters were permanently assigned, or put in bed, with US military units for life.</p>\n<p>Since then temporary assignments have become standard fare, from Korea and Vietnam to Afghanistan where journalists have always had the option of opting out and going back to the tea rooms.</p>\n<p>Not any more. Once a correspondent is shacked-up with a unit, the journalist can consider themselves a soldier/reporter with that unit for life. And Ricky will frown on anyone wanting to go home early &#8212; that&#8217;s desertion. Snubbing victory parades is also a big no-no.</p>\n<p>A nicer touch is that all embedded reporters will receive a big shiny badge indicating their unit, which the hardened hacks agree is a welcome accessory to the gas masks and the nuclear, chemical and biological suits.</p>\n<p>Unconfirmed rumors at this late hour speak of two journalists who have decided to skirt the embed policy by borrowing a pantomime camel from an amateur dramatics club somewhere in Europe. Their plan is to sneak across the border in their cunning disguise and arrive in Baghdad ahead of the rest of the press corps.</p>\n<p>But back to the change of hotel venue. Ricky&#8217;s friends said he, among others, decided the Sheraton was not so safe, as its front and back side are rather exposed and offer those nasty terrorists unfettered access for their shoddy designs.</p>\n<p>So everyone had to move.</p>\n<p>Tea time, served by my subversive friend Waqil, just won&#8217;t be the same. The Hilton does have impressive beach but holds all the charm of a headquarters occupied by a 1990s software company.</p>\n<p>However, it shouldn&#8217;t prove too stressful for too long. Yours truly has booked rooms, a penthouse pour moi and a broom closet for Waqil and his still at Baghdad&#8217;s charming al-Rashid hotel from mid-March.</p>\n<p>Alas, some people still think the prospect of war is a fallacy.</p>\n<p>Ricky is not allowed to talk about such matters, but speculation at the Kuwait Stock Exchange are under no such restrictions. According to one insider the US military has ordered 4,000 air-conditioners to be delivered to Basra in southern Iraq by mid-April.</p>\n<p>Who knows? Not the hacks that&#8217;s for sure. But just in case the stock exchange gurus are right, I have ensured that my camel is packed and ready to roll. Until the next time, dear readers, my very best wishes to all.

Kuwaitis celebrating their 12th Liberation Day with the prospect that Saddam Hussein won&#8217;t be around for another year. Black Label flowed (legal exemptions were made for friends of the Emir) and roasted camel was delivered on a 30-foot silver platter, all served by Waqil whom I had lent to my hosts at the Hilton for the evening. My camel was none too impressed by dinner and left.</p>\n<p>Then, disaster. In bumbled &#8211; albeit in a BMW limousine complete with driver, on-board computers, television and Global Positioning Systems &#8211; the notorious hacks Lindsay Murdoch and Luke Hunt. Both had discarded the comforts of reporting from five-star retreats embedded with the Marines and were plotting to catch up with the equally uncouth friend of the Phnom Penh Post Nate Thayer, whom I am told is residing in my room at the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad.</p>\n<p>The rest is fog. The two Australians stole my Chivas and forced me into toasting the silly fools with betrothed war brides. Murdoch is getting married to Miss Feni Hawati, and another occasional Cambodian drop-in Karl Malakunas will wed Miss Amy Chung &#8211; once that blight Saddam is removed.</p>\n<p>I vaguely remember Hunt offering the 32nd toast and asking a guest, Captain Jacov of the Marines, if he expected to make Major soon. Then nothing.</p>\n<p>I woke up Shanghai-ed, parked under an Abrams tank somewhere in the deserts of northern Kuwait, with a tongue that tasted like lino glue. Waqil at my boot, and my camel, who has since been dubbed Spit after escaping roast dinner, nearby.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I asked for directions to the Hilton but was told &#8220;Nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;, Sir.&#8221; Murdoch and company had crossed my t&#8217;s and dumped me with a Marine combat unit within a hand grenade&#8217;s throw of the border.</p>\n<p>Even my good friends, the Emir and Colonel Ricky Thomas (who can&#8217;t be quoted), failed me and now I&#8217;m a Marine, with a shiny badge.</p>\n<p>Ricky&#8217;s friends said not to worry, the war will start immediately after that nuisance of a deadline, March 17, passes and a celebration feast will be held within a few days. As another tawdry Marine wrote on his helmet: &#8220;There&#8217;s beer in Baghdad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A drop of mellow red would be preferable, but by living with the Marines one does pick up on the odd item that would normally escape the halls of my usual comforts. Here&#8217;s one: the 82nd Airborne captain who was conducting a live-fire operation on the border when he noticed a jeep with a white flag billowing from the back and making an approach from the wrong side of the border.</p>\n<p>An Iraqi officer disembarked and they met. The Iraqi and his three men wanted to give themselves up, but were told they were &#8220;too early&#8221;as the starter&#8217;s whistle hadn&#8217;t blown. The hapless chaps were compelled to go, but invited to come back once the bombing started.</p>\n<p>So they left. The 82nd were also delighted after the Iraqi officer pointed out on his departure a clean trail through what they had assumed was a heavily-mined section of Iraqi soil.</p>\n<p>My camel, Spit, and my subversive friend, Waqil, were equally thrilled with the news, and so I have promised them it is the demined path the three of us shall tread on our seemingly inexorable journey to Baghdad.

Separated from the main convoy we crisscrossed the back-blocks of Southern Iraq gulping sand in zero visibility with our dear but annoyed Lance Corporal looking for someone to kill.</p>\n<p>Carr told me he had a girlfriend which I said was good for a man of his condition.</p>\n<p>Eventually the main convoy was found. We were told it had splintered after taking fire. It took another day-and-a-half to find the missing. Almost all were accounted for.</p>\n<p>Just before crossing into Iraq we were briefed by Colonel Joe Dowdy, who bears a strong resemblance to Marlon Brando&#8217;s Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. He declared at the start the start of his military chat with the civilized press: &#8220;I&#8217;m a dead romantic and I make no apologies for it. We have the tools to go inside Iraq and impose our will.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That will was supposed to put us within 200 kilometers of of Baghdad within three days. By Day Three his beloved moonstruck marines were nowhere in sight of that target and still getting lost, so I ditched Carr and hitched a ride with an ambulance straight into Nasariyah, where disaster struck.</p>\n<p>The Iraqis held off for three days and two bloody nights, inflicting the worst casualties of the war to date.which made Dowdy&#8217;s romantice notions appear shamefully insane. Those Iraqi chaps actually enjoy and good fight. Al-Fdihr will play to the death and definitely don&#8217;t like invaders. The American enemy halted the entire show at night after the Iraqis used the moonlight to spot and pin down the advance but it cost the Iraqis dearly. I counted morew than 100 dead on the roadside. Their flesh was still burning. One civilian car had taken a missile straight through its roof. Odd thing though its headlights were still on.</p>\n<p>Despite what Washington says, its coalition war does not go that well Four-and-a-half days were lost in the first six by 5,000 marines. Baghdad is not in sight and in its defense Washington offers cleches like &#8220;tactical shifts&#8221; which are being thrown around by senior brass like grog from Waqil&#8217;s still in a dry country.</p>\n<p>The lines that followed our first night of confusion included: &#8220;Some bullets were heard and people strayed. This is expected in this kind of invasion. No big deal.&#8221; Not quite my interpretation of events.</p>\n<p>Which reminds me of Lance Corporal Carr whose magazines were rather tasteful. Later that night the moon eventually came into sight. He pointed at it, looked at me and said with an I-told-you-so gr5in spread wide across his face: &#8220;See the moon is always in the sky at night.

The medics had run out of space so Abdul was placed on the hood of our ambulance (a Humvee load with guns and drugs) as corpsman Tony Garcia stood over him, acting as a human shield through the crossfire of two battles until a safe place could be found for the hapless Iraqi.</p>\n<p>Despite Garcia&#8217;s bravery and will; to save his enemy&#8217;s life, Abdul died. In this war, as in all others, luck clearly plays a deft hand. US trooper Jessica Lynch had it and was rescued from Iraqi captors in Nasariyha by soldiers from Delta Force.</p>\n<p>Colonel Joe Dowdy and a handful of journalists were lucky too when whn Iraqi artillery fired eight rounds at our tent. Each round has a kill circle of of 100 meters, and the Iraqis missed by only 300 meters from a distance of 19 kilometers.</p>\n<p>A Marine in Shirat was fresh out of it, shot, strung-up from a town-square and his corpse desecrated. Fate dealt seven women and children a bad hand too when a US soldier opened fire because the word &#8220;stop&#8221; is not part of the Iraqi vocabulary.</p>\n<p>The miserable cost of war is high but Dowdy&#8217;s troops pushed onto the gates of Baghdad. Along the way thousands of children, women and men lined the highways, waving and cheering on the Marines, hailing them as liberators from the torment of Saddam Hussein.</p>\n<p>Then, with victory in clear view and our commander ready to pounce, the senior brass imposed their will and and relieved Dowdy of his post.</p>\n<p>For reasons known only to the generals, Colonel Dowdy had been dealt an embarrassing clear career killing blow, gutted just as he was poised for the march into Baghdad, and a once-in-a-lifetime shot at military glory.</p>\n<p>The troops were genuinely upset. They likened this to Preident Truman&#8217;s sacking of General Douglas MacAuthur and suggested tha Dowdy must have committed some unspeakable act with a general&#8217;s daughter to warrant such treatment.</p>\n<p>Dowdy was out of luck. One ponders such things over a cup of morning coffee: the dead, concepts of glory, and a chap named Bernie.</p>\n<p>There was nowhere to put Abdul after he died, but he had to kept until the paperwork was cleared so the lads wrapped him in a blanket and duct-tapped him to the trailer where fitted neatly between the wheel hub and my coffee pot.</p>\n<p>Henceforth he was known as Bernie &#8212; our dead witness to the imposition of Dowdy&#8217;s will &#8212; and the lads in my platoon had him over for the weekend. We made coffee and ate biscuits and cheese donated by Bernie&#8217;s fellow Iraqis.</p>\n<p>At some point I was warned by a Lieutenant-Colonel not to write about Dowdy being relieved of his post because this was &#8220;highly embarrassing for him and his family&#8221; and I risked being alienated by the senior ranks if Dowdy&#8217;s demise made it into the newspapers.</p>\n<p>Bernie had no such objections so I decided to write.</p>\n<p>PS: In my next missive I hope to catch up with my subversive friend Waqil and provide an update on just how well my camel, Spit, is fairing in the raging desert heat, which is now topping 43 degrees Celsius.

He filed this piece on April 21.</em></p>\n<p>BAGHDAD: In one corner, combatants of the self-styled milita known as the Free Iraqi Forces are holding court. A muslim cleric and his entourage sweep past soldiers in full battledress while a middle-aged man hustles whisky out of a plastic bag.</p>\n<p>A marine yells: &#8220;Clear a path&#8221; as General James Mattis tries to leave. But the order is ignored by the hundreds who fill the hotel lobby. His bodyguards deploy the butts of their M-16 assault rifles to force an exit.</p>\n<p>Cameras flash and journalists shove microphones under the noses of ranking military in the hope of securing an elusive quote. Noone is quite sure whether General Tommy Franks will pop in for a kebab.</p>\n<p>A mix of cigarette smoke and the aroma of Turkish coffee fill the air as a blear-eyed soldiers twinkles the ivories on a beaten-up piano. He attempts As Time Goes By, then settles for Chopsticks .</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s rush hour in at the Palestine Hotel and the end of the war in Iraq has delivered a circus of characters that would test the imagination of any Hollywood scriptwriter.</p>\n<p>The Palestine is not quite The Ritz in Paris after World War II but its atmosphere is comparable with the al-Rashid in the first Gulf War or even Saigon&#8217;s Continental or Phnom Penh&#8217;s Le Royale during the Vietnam War era.</p>\n<p>It is, however, a little more dangerous, gunfire is common, there are looters a plenty and nobody is riding the elevators that tend to freefall between the third and 15th floors and have been rather aptly dubbed Palestine Airlines.</p>\n<p>Between these floors self-interest is the fastest horse. One Iraqi has declared himself mayor of Baghdad, another the governor of Iraq. Neither has told the US military but they argue their positions were authenticated by interviews they gave on CNN where veteran correspondent has been hanging around since NBC relieved him of his last command. Arnett was last seen freelance for a Greek television network.</p>\n<p>Outside the Marines have pitched their tents and are giving themselves a pat on the back for a job well done. Except for Colonel Joe Dowdy who I can say was relieved of his post for failing to &#8220;combine all the elements of a combat regiment and running it at a tempo comparable to the war.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s according to his boss. I guess Colonel failed to impose his will.</p>\n<p>My subversive friend Waqil, last spotted in northern Kuwait is now selling over-fermented beer for seven bucks a can which he stores in Spit&#8217;s camel-bags. Spit proved rather popular among the British officers in Basra and is undecided about leaving. Waqil is demanding four months back pay &#8212; cheeky sod doesn&#8217;t appreciate my best wishes.</p>\n<p>But pleasing, this war is drawing to a close.</p>\n<p>You know how I know? Those detestable do-gooders have started showing up disguised as NGOs with their usual opinions, well-honed from the backpacker hostels in Kao Sanh Road in Bangkok.</p>\n<p>For the military, our main point of contact for the entire war is Corporal john Hoellwarth, who at 22, some people would argue is a little young for the post. I like the lad but did raise an eyebrow when a lovely 16-year-old sauntered past prompting John to quip: &#8220;Wow, she looks like Jasmine in the cartoon series Aladdin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He then confirmed that a string of Saddam&#8217;s henchmen had been arrested, no weapons of mass destruction had been found, and more civilians had been killed. But he couldn&#8217;t restore the nearest electricity grid first to allow us a hot bath.</p>\n<p>Once again it is chic to be anti-American and anti-war. That is a good thing for the folks in Syria and North Korea, though I remain uncertain about whether Iraq&#8217;s ousted strongman Saddam Hussein is still grateful for their previous efforts.</p>\n<p>Thus I have packed my bags and booked myself on the next flight to Beirut. Waqil shan&#8217;t be needed unless he apologizes for being greedy. Spit shall follow. I simply won&#8217;t allow those Brits in basra to advantage of his sensitive side.</p>\n<p>Speaking of sensitive sides I do remember Colonel Rick Thomas (he cannot be quoted) telling me at the start of all this that we would be embedded with the military for life and the current noises about Syria are irritating. Ricky and I will not meet again. Next time I shall ensure total coverage from the Hotel Maurice in Paris.</p>\n<p>Until next time, dear`readers &#8212; and there will be a next time, perhaps Cambodia for the elections? I bid you a fond farewell and look forward to meeting the legions in your capital&#8217;s fine bars.

It’s hardly a coveted title but there are a broad range of countries not far behind the leader’s board and Mexico is rapidly catching up.</p>\n<p>According to a tally by El Universal, the country’s top-selling newspaper, 12 reporters, photographers, editors and radio hosts have been slain this year, mostly for reporting on drug trafficking and the corruption that accompanies the trade.</p>\n<p>Among the recently killed was Vladimir Antuna García a crime correspondent for El Tiempo de Durango newspaper. He had escaped an attack in April, one month before his colleague, Carlos Ortega Samper, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most journalists are killed not in war zones but in their own countries as they try to shine the light of the truth into the darkest recesses of their societies,&#8221; local unions said at a United Nations-backed World Electronic Media Forum in Mexico City.</p>\n<p>Garcia’s slaying received little coverage. Drug related killings in Mexico are even outstripping Thailand’s infamous war on drugs earlier this decade. So far this year more than 5,000 apparent drug-related killings were recorded in Mexico.</p>\n<p>“This is what happened to me for giving information to the military and writing what I shouldn’t. Take care of your texts before you do your story,” said a message scrawled on cardboard next to the body.</p>\n<p>The deaths in Mexico cast a shadow over the odd blessings elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Too often this column details the incarceration of journalists but occasionally there are pleasant surprises. In Afghanistan 46-year-old a Norwegian journalist Paal Refsdal and his Afghan interpreter were released after a week in captivity.</p>\n<p>Refsdal was taken near the border with Pakistan and information about the kidnapping had circulated among Norwegian media outlets but they chose not to publish after calls from the foreign ministry in order not to jeopardize the pair&#8217;s safety.</p>\n<p>Authorities in Tehran have released Farhad Pouladi, an Iranian journalist who works for Agence France-Presse (AFP). Pouladi was among more than 100 people arrested during pro-government and opposition street demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Iranian security forces beat anti-government protesters with batons on the sidelines of state-sanctioned rallies to mark the 30th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover.</p>\n<p>Also on the pleasant side of the ledger is a pardon by Saudi Arabia&#8217;s king of a female journalist, Rosana Al-Yami. She was sentenced to 60 lashes for her role in a television show in which a Saudi man detailed his sexual exploits.</p>\n<p>She worked a co-ordinator for the popular show Bold Red Lines. In one episode, Mazen Abdul-Jawad spoke from his bed on how he picked up girls in Jeddah and had sex with them. He was sentenced to five years in jail and 1,000 lashes.</p>\n<p>FIFA has also done the media a favour by banning Argentina manager Diego Maradona from football for two months as punishment for his rant at journalists who covered his team’s performance during Argentina&#8217;s qualification for the World Cup finals.</p>\n<p>It was not Maradona’s first altercation with the press. In 1994 he shot at journalists with an air rifle outside his home in Buenos Aires. Four people were injured and the footballer was given a suspended jail sentence.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The committee took into consideration the apologies and the sincere remorse shown by Maradona in its decision,” FIFA said.</p>\n<p>In Phnom Penh, the Overseas Press Club of Cambodia (OPCC) has found some traction and is about to elect a new president after being put on hold for more than two years due to differences among previous board members.</p>\n<p>Canadian Pat Falby of Agence France-Presse is tipped to become president in a move that most foreign correspondents hope will re-establish the club in the country&#8217;s sometimes troubled media circles.</p>\n<p>His election could not have come sooner. Press freedoms have been curtailed over recent years with local reporters bearing the brunt of information laws that carry hefty fines and jail terms.</p>\n<p>Publisher Hang Chakra, who was jailed for one year in June for spreading disinformation, is being supported by King Norodom Sihamoni who has asked prime minister Hun Sen to grant him an amnesty.</p>\n<p>Chakra, a well regarded figure among local hands, was jailed after a series of articles were published in may and June accusing officials working under Deputy Prime Minister Sok An of corruption.</p>\n<p>Also jailed is freelance journalist Ros Sokhet for spreading disinformation after he sent text messages to Soy Sopheap, news anchor with the Cambodian Television Network.</p>\n<p>He received a two year sentence after being charged under the UNTAC penal code, introduced here for the 1992-93 by the United Nations Transitional Authority of Cambodia, instead of the country&#8217;s more liberal press laws.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are appropriate civil laws in place to resolve media-related complaints and Cambodian press laws should be applied to assist in their resolution,&#8221; The International Federation of Journalists said after the sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p>Thinking of Mexico and Cambodia reminds me of Singapore and those titans of democracy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his dad Lee Kuan Yew who picked up $US290,000 from a local court after they complained about a story published by the Far Eastern Economic Review and its editor Hugo Restall.</p>\n<p>It was perhaps a fitting swan song for FEER as its owners, Dow Jones &amp; Co, are about to send the once mighty publication into permanent retirement.</p>\n<p>“The Court casts significant doubt as to whether Singapore will ever recognize the fair and honest reporting privilege accorded to responsible journalism – a privilege available in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries with diverse histories and cultures,” Dow Jones, which disagreed with the verdict, said.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Mexican Mayhem Flavored with a Singapore Sling Routinely Iraq, Afghanistan and The Philippines share top billing as the most dangerous place on earth for journalists.

The pair were kidnapped by Taliban militia on September 5 while reporting on a possible botched NATO airstrike that left 90 people dead.</p>\n<p>Farrel, a Brit with dual Irish citizenship, had apparently ignored warnings not travel into the area.</p>\n<p>NYT then carried out what was reported as a quiet but intense campaign to keep the story out of the news so as not to be seen as “raising the temperature.”</p>\n<p>A raid by British commandos followed. Farrell, 46, was rescued but Munadi, 32, along with a British commando and at least three other people, said to be a Taliban commander, the owner of the compound and a local woman, died.</p>\n<p>NYT Executive Editor Bill Keller told National Public Radio (NPR) in the US that newspaper officials thought coverage of the case would put the captured reporter and his Afghan assistant in even greater danger.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this case, we had some early word through intermediaries that this might be resolvable and that we could persuade the captors that these guys were legitimate journalists, doing important work, and that they should be released,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Munadi’s brother, however, described the operation as thoughtless.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was no need for this operation at all,&#8221; Munadi&#8217;s brother Mohammad Osman told Agence France-Presse. &#8220;The ICRC (the International Committee for the Red Cross), the United Nations, tribal elders were all involved in optimistic negotiations for their release, when all of sudden this raid took place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot blame one particular person for this, it is everyone &#8211; the government, The New York Times, Taliban and finally the main responsibility for his death lies with British forces who launched this unnecessary operation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The deaths comes amid reports that Islamabad might try a restrict visa access to US journalists which would hamper their ability to travel in and out of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Western journalists have long been harassed by Pakistani security officials and potential restrictions follow complaints by US media organisations and published articles that question Islamabad’s commitment to freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>It has been reported that Hussain Haqqani, Pakistan&#8217;s ambassador to the US, wrote a letter to the Foreign Secretary and chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence warning them that harassing Americans or denying them visas could cost Pakistan severely.</p>\n<p>It’s this type of experience that continues to haunt Indonesia. The Australian Federal Police have notified the families of the five journalists killed in 1975 at Balibo in East Timor that it had begun an investigation into the killings.</p>\n<p>A coronial inquest into the death of Channel Nine reporter Brian Peters two years ago concluded that Indonesian soldiers deliberately killed the journalists to cover up Indonesia’s invasion of East Timor.</p>\n<p>As then opposition leader, current Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had pledged to follow up the recommendations of the inquiry and the deaths of Peters, Malcolm Rennie, Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart and Gary Cunningham.</p>\n<p>The coronial inquest found Peters was shot and/or stabbed deliberately, and not in the heat of battle, by members of the Indonesian Special Forces.</p>\n<p>It named Christoforus da Silva and Captain Yunus Yosfiah as acting on the orders of Captain Yosfiah, to prevent revelations that Indonesian Special Forces were involved in the attack.</p>\n<p>Paul Stewart, younger brother of Tony, told Australian media: ”I am glad though that those who will face the glare of the spotlight is the Javanese military elite who killed not only my brother, but hundreds of thousands of East Timorese, West Papuans and Indonesians as well.”</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Counting the Cost of Freedom Two American journalists, one British reporter and an Afghan have defied recent trends and were released from detention for crimes that could hardly have justified their incarceration.

The FCCT will cooperate with such an inquiry,&#8221; FCCT President Marwaan Macan-Markar said.</p>\n<p>Lese-majeste is punishable by up to 15 years in prison in Thailand where many people regard the 81-year-old monarch as semi-divine.</p>\n<p>Editors and journalists working in Thailand have complained privately and bitterly that reckless use of the law was stifling the country’s free press at time when its honesty was needed most.</p>\n<p>However, to say this publicly risks being charged with lese majeste.</p>\n<p>In neighbouring Cambodia, two locally-based hands have been tied up in knots &#8212; legally and literally.</p>\n<p>Kevin Doyle, editor of the Cambodian Daily is expecting to front court after his paper published comments from opposition politician Ho Vann who questioned the academic quality of Vietnamese university degrees that were conferred on 22 Cambodian military officers.</p>\n<p>The story was written by Neou Vannarin and Doyle, an Irishman, immediately leapt to his reporter’s defence.</p>\n<p>Writing in his own newspaper, Doyle said: “If there is a complaint of defamation to be answered concerning the story that was written Mr Neou then it should be I, as editor-in-chief, who is called to trial, as I am the individual most responsible for this article and not the reporter.”</p>\n<p>One wonders how many editors elsewhere, with much larger resources at their disposal, would be bold enough to take on 20-odd Khmer officers in a Cambodian court.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile George McLeod found himself strung-up along with scores of pro-democracy protestors in an Iranian jail. No court appearances required here.</p>\n<p>The Cambodian-based Canadian had just finished up at the Phnom Penh Post and decided to use the Iranian elections as a launch pad for a freelance career.</p>\n<p>But the authorities, perhaps confused by his slight Middle East appearance, assumed McLeod was a local student who didn&#8217;t agree with the result.</p>\n<p>“I was seized by riot police and taken by motorbike to a location near the interior ministry where I was pulled and attacked by about five officers, including one in a military style of uniform who grabbed me by the neck,” McLeod told Max.</p>\n<p>“I was then driven to the interior ministry building and led down a dark flight of stairs where I was interrogated. Several dozen males were being held in stress positions in the basement, and I saw one prisoner being brought in with what looked like a broken nose.”</p>\n<p>McLeod was searched and questioned, told a mistake was made and free to go but he would be arrested four times during his 11-day stay.</p>\n<p>“The authorities knew well that I was a reporter, and I was wearing my press card on the outside of my clothes. Nevertheless, I am certain that my treatment was mild to say the least compared to what an Iranian would have been through.”</p>\n<p>Reporters Sans Frontieres says 41 journalists were imprisoned in Iran a month after the country&#8217;s contested election. It described Iran as the world&#8217;s biggest prison for journalists, and was becoming the world&#8217;s most dangerous place for them to operate.</p>\n<p>However, others proved that journalists could be just as fallible as anyone else.</p>\n<p>Peter Lloyd, an Australian television reporter, was freed from a Singapore jail after serving almost seven months of a 10-month sentence for drug offences.</p>\n<p>Lloyd, former New Delhi-based correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, was jailed last December after pleading guilty to three drug charges.</p>\n<p>Time off for good behavior resulted in an early release.</p>\n<p>Lloyd was sentenced to eight months for possessing 0.41 grams the stimulant methamphetamine and another eight months for consuming it. He received an additional two months for possessing drug paraphernalia stained with ketamine.</p>\n<p>His defence argued the drugs helped alleviate the pain caused by post-traumatic stress that followed years of covering wars and disasters in Asia.</p>\n<p>Trafficking charges, which carried a prison term of between five and 20 years as well as five to 15 strokes of the cane, were earlier dropped. One can only hope that journalists who find themselves incarcerated for simply doing their job are so lucky.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Courting the Law and Silencing Critics Stiletto by Max Kolbe – July, 2009 The bullying of journalists around the region continues to be played out before the courts with politicians, military officers, the odd fixer <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/stiletto-by-max-kolbe-%e2%80%93-july-2009/\" title=\"Stiletto by Max Kolbe – July, 2009\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2009-07-15 12:17:51',8,2,12,'2009-07-15 12:17:51','2010-05-05 17:29:42'),(300,300,'https://d18sfhl837dknt.cloudfront.net/featured/J1aR7bQQON3gwr3GipXyXJ1gmA3FSwKiRfjCj8hr.jpg','Stiletto by Max Kolbe – May, 2009','stiletto-by-max-kolbe-e28093-may-2009','<p><strong>Why Shoot?

Across East Asia and the Pacific the media game is changing.</p>\n<p>The takeover of Reuters by Thomson is obviously having an enormous impact and was particularly felt down under where Australian Associated Press (AAP) with Clive Marshall at the helm has ended its long-standing and exclusive arrangements with Reuters after the British-based agency upped its prices.</p>\n<p>It was an historical decision, given that AAP led the syndicate made up of Commonwealth wire services that bailed Reuters out of bankruptcy at the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>New Zealand Press Association, South African Press Association and Canadian Press were also in on the initial deal that paved the way for Reuter&#8217;s enormous success, stock market float and the eventual busting of the bubble as newcomers like Bloomberg made their presence felt.</p>\n<p>Reuters &#8212; it would appear &#8212; was also hoping to sell exclusively to the major newspaper groups in Australia as opposed to dealing solely through AAP.</p>\n<p>A terse statement was released. It said: &#8220;From today AAP wire copy provided to newspaper groups Fairfax Media and News Limited will not include any Reuters stories. After Reuters increased its price, AAP dropped the contract and the newspapers have chosen not to buy the service directly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As one insider put it: &#8220;Clive Marshall is, I&#8217;m told, furious.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Old allegiances rarely count these days although one exception remains The Phnom Penh Post, widely regarded &#8216;as the best little newspaper on the planet&#8217; has dropped its once every two week format and gone daily.</p>\n<p>This was made possible after founder and publisher Michael Hayes sold the paper to a group of Australian businessmen headed by Ross Dunkley.</p>\n<p>Hayes will remain editor-in-chief while Seth Meixner has left his position as Cambodian bureau chief for Agence France-Presse (AFP), taken up the reins as managing editor and immediately gone on a hiring binge, much to the displeasure of the folks who run the Cambodia Daily.</p>\n<p>Dunkley, who has faced critics for operating newspapers in Burma and Vietnam, is well aware of the PPPost&#8217;s reputation and has a battle plan, along with some deep pockets.</p>\n<p>Speculation includes a possible Khmer edition, and development of radio and televisions interests but for the critics Dunkley has one piece of advice, &#8220;you can&#8217;t kick goals by screaming from the sidelines.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At least he says, his interests past and present in Burma, Vietnam and now Cambodia had put the Australian on the football field where goals can be kicked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like all the rules, I abide by them,&#8221; he recently said about operating under a junta in Burma.</p>\n<p>At least he&#8217;s there. No points for the Australian film crew who so badly wanted a journalist visa stamp for Burma on their passports they actually applied for one &#8212; as hacks were tripping over each other while trying to get in after that cyclone ripped through the heart of the country.</p>\n<p>The lame Aussies were actually miffed when told they would have been granted a visa if they listed anything other than journalist on their application forms. They never made it in.</p>\n<p>The decision to take PPPost daily was also timed to coincide with national elections. As a once in five year event, Cambodian polls have a habit of attracting die hards and are as popular as fifth-year Vietnam War reunions among the more seasoned hands.</p>\n<p>Former DPA hand Pat Falby returned from New York and the Canadian has taken up Meixner&#8217;s old job at AFP.

I had a cop raise both his fist in front of my face and when I took his photo like that he grabbed another copper&#8217;s &#8216;lathi&#8217; (inch-thick, 1.5m long bamboo baton) and raised it above his head as if he was going to clobber me. His colleagues restrained him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Photographers were repeatedly pushed away from scenes of police beating monks and other protesters. During one such scuffle, one Nepali freelance photographer was punched and another (AFP snapper) hit in the back of the legs with a lathi.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This caused heated scenes as the two Nepali snappers confronted the cops involved and wanted to go at it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The commanding officer intervened on several occasions to calm his men down, but problem seems to be that individual guys get so worked up and aggressive they just want to fight with everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Dushanbe, Tajikistan police have seized three suspects in the murder of Russian television reporter Ilyas Shurpayev, who was found stabbed in his Moscow apartment last month.</p>\n<p>Shurpayev worked for Russia&#8217;s state-owned television and reported on unrest in the Caucasus. His body was found to have multiple knife wounds and he had a belt wrapped around his neck.</p>\n<p>Shurpayev was the author of numerous reports about the mostly Muslim North Caucasus mountain region in southern Russia, where there are frequent clashes between security forces and local rebels.</p>\n<p>In Cairo, outspoken Egyptian editor Ibrahim Eissa was sentenced to six months in jail for writing rumours about President Hosni Mubarak&#8217;s health. Human rights groups are demanding the laws be changed.</p>\n<p>Eissa, editor-in-chief of Al-Dustur, was charged with spreading &#8220;false information&#8230; damaging the public interest and national stability&#8221;. He was facing up to three years in prison.</p>\n<p>He had been due to be tried before a state security court where he would have had no right of appeal, but eventually the trial took place in an ordinary court after what the journalists&#8217; union called regime backpedalling.</p>\n<p>“This verdict is against all international human rights conventions,&#8221; Eissa told the AFP newsagency after judge Sherif Kamel Mustapha handed down the sentence in a Cairo court.</p>\n<p>He said the verdict showed the regime&#8217;s hostility to the press and &#8220;affirms the holiness of President Mubarak and the rejection of any criticism of him or his policies.

He struck oil with the Americans in return for ditching a nuclear power plant, got the South Koreans back to bargaining table, was awarded his first prize in journalism and a floral extravaganza marked his 65th birthday party.</div><div>The birthday bash surely proved a must for the Pyongyang’s champagne quaffing social elite. A local hybrid begonia has been renamed Kimjongilia and if last year was anything to go by then at least 23,000 potted Kimjongilias went on display.</div><div>And how do we know about such fascinating insights of the hermit kingdom?</div><div>The answer, of course, is the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), a wire service which has carried dispatches for a few favoured clients on the ins and outs of North Korean politics and for the last decade has boasted Dear Leader at the helm.</div><div>As the official mouth piece for Pyongyang, editorial independence has never been its strongest suit but from the very beginning Kim has asserted his own editorial policies and his efforts have produced some unique results</div><div>Ten years ago when he made his push for absolute power KCNA reported that mother nature celebrated the move as cherry blossoms bloomed out of season — and during a rather memorable famine — a pear tree also sprouted 400 blossoms and five 10-year-old apricot trees bore fruit on a farm in Sangwon Country.</div><div>Importantly, Kim’s ascendancy was timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the death of his father, The Great Leader Kim Song-il. KCNA once quoted dad as saying: “Whenever I retrospect my days in Wangqing, I always remember the legendary white horse with which I went through the flames of the anti-Japanese war.”</div><div>Like great correspondents of old, the KCNA scribes were also on hand when a wagtail commemorated the anniversary of the Great Leader’s passing by perching atop the then newly erected Immortality Tower in Inchon County where the distraught bird “sat and cried”. On the morning of July 7 (1997) an equally distressed owl made the same pilgrimage.</div><div>Then as the announcement came through of the younger Kim’s victory in North Korea’s homestyled elections: “Fisherman caught a 10cm white sea cucumber while fishing on the waters off Chongjin.”</div><div>“They said the rare white cucumber has come to hail the auspicious event of electing Comrade Kim Jong-Il as Party General Secretary,” the KCNA dispatch read.</div><div>Since those formative years under the stewardship of Kim Jong-Il the agency has gone from strength to strength covering the serious issues of Korean reunification and nuclear proliferation to setting the world straight on local history and providing lifestyle choices.</div><div>For instance, a recipe straight from grandma’s kitchen: “The rice-cake soup, a favorite dish of the Korean people, is tasty and nutritious.&nbsp; It is made by the method of slightly boiling the sliced long slender white rice-cake in pheasant gravy and putting processed pheasant meat and spices into it. The dish can also be made with chicken instead of pheasant.</div><div>“From this custom elders, when asking the age of a child, often say, ‘How many bowls of soup have you ate?\'”</div><div>And who can forget the noble efforts of the Pyongyang Hospital of Koryo Medicine which developed further practical uses for marijuana in a medical breakthrough known as “taehwangmain” a medicine designed to treat chronic constipation.</div><div>“Made of rhubarb, cannabis sativa and elecampane, herbs in Korea, gives no harmful effect to internal organs but activates their functions and promotes digestion by dissolving bile well.”</div><div>On KCNA there’s the usual backslapping among what’s left of the Communist movement scattered around the world and the ritualised propaganda where some choice words are reserved for those with whom North Korea is displeased.</div><div>For instance: The US military are “hare-brained brigands”, Donald Rumsfeld was “a stupid” and a “embicile” while Dick Cheney, they say, is “mentally deranged”, and George W. Bush tends to “let loose a string of balderdash”.</div><div>But when the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has something serious to say, you better pay attention. Like this report from December 2005: “The Korean Central News Agency today issued a detailed report in connection with the fact that the construction of Light Water Reactors promoted by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization under the U.S. supervision came to a final end.”</div><div>Perhaps, few believed them. But then, in October the following year KCNA rocked and scooped the world with a stunning announcement:</div><div>“The field of scientific research in the DPRK successfully conducted an underground nuclear test under secure conditions on October 9 at a stirring time when all the people of the country are making a great leap forward in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation.”</div><div>“The nuclear test was conducted with indigenous wisdom and technology 100 percent. It marks a historic event as it greatly encouraged and pleased the KPA (that’s the army) and people that have wished to have powerful self-reliant defence capability.”</div><div>With such an illustrious media career behind him it should come as no surprise that Kim Jong-Il was awarded the titles of honorary professor and “Master of Journalists” and the education merit medal from Guayaquil University of Ecuador on the occasion of his birthday.</div><div>KCNA reported: “Carved in the medal are words reading ‘To the great leader Kim Jong Il’ and ‘In high praise of feats performed for university education’.” High feats indeed.</div>',1,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Few correspondents can match the wit of Sheikh Ya&#8217;erbuti, nor his brooding insights into the Hermit Kingdom and the floral arrangements that made it In North Korea, Dear leader Kim Jong-il has enjoyed a terrific <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/north-korea-observed-kim-jong-il-a-winner-says-it-with-flowers/\" title=\"Kim Jong-il says it with Flowers\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2008-10-12 00:00:00',4,2,28,'2008-10-12 15:49:19','2023-03-08 16:47:48'),(356,356,'https://d18sfhl837dknt.cloudfront.net/featured/J1aR7bQQON3gwr3GipXyXJ1gmA3FSwKiRfjCj8hr.jpg','Kung Hei Fat Choi &#8212; Website Up-Dated','kung-hei-fat-choi-website-up-dated-relaunched','<p>HONG KONG, Feb 14, 2010 &#8212; Bomborra Productions (BbP) launched its up-dated website on Chinese New Year&#8217;s Day, with a significant expansion on its predecessor Bomborra Images which was established five years earlier as a small photo library.

Some now fear Cambodia could be used as a hideout for terrorists.</em></p>\n<p>by <strong><a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/story-board/luke-hunt/\">Luke Hunt</a></strong> in Phum Trea and Phnom Penh, filed the following dispatch for the <em>Far Eastern Economic Review.</em></p>\n<p>In the village of Phum Trea, Imam Mohamad Abdul Majit is proudly showing off his community&#8217;s latest addition. A mosque built in brilliant white marble, twice the size of the holiest mosque in Phnom Penh. Next door is a new madrassa, or Islamic school with three floors and at least 15 classrooms.<em></em></p>\n<p>The gleaming mosque isn’t the only thing distinguishes Phum Trea from most other villages in this predominantly Buddhist nation. On a relentlessly hot day, a woman approaches the mosque dressed in traditional Arab dress. Only her eyes can be seen in her flowing black robes. The imam explains that local girls can wear non-Islamic clothes outside the villages but not inside it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When going to the national schools they wear the uniform of Cambodian girls, but when here they wear the cloths of the Muslim school,&#8221; he explains.</p>\n<p>The conservative Dawa Tabligh movement along with the ultra-orthodox Wahabi strain of Islam, are transforming the lives of Cambodia&#8217;s predominantly ethnic Cham Muslims. Like Muslims in many other parts of Southeast Asia, the Chams traditionally followed a syncretic form of Islam that incorporates elements from Buddhism and pre-Islamic belief systems. But in recent years, an estimated 40% of Chams have switched over to the more orthodox Dawa Tabligh and Wahabi branches of Islam.</p>\n<p>Their reasons are not hard to understand. The Chams account for just 700,000 &#8212; or around 5% &#8212; of Cambodia&#8217;s population of 13 million, and have long been victims of discrimination. In the late 1970s, the bloody reign of the Khmer Rouge came close to annihilating them. By the early 1990s, after three decades of civil war, there were just 20 mosques left. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States and 2002 in Bali, the Chams have come under fresh suspicions from Cambodia&#8217;s majority Khmers, with complaints also of police and official harassment.</p>\n<p>As a result, many Cham communities have looked overseas for financial and other support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The scale of change among ethnic Chams is breathtaking,&#8221; says Norwegian anthropologist Bjorn Blengsi, who has made extensive studies of Cham society.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Alien cultures derived from Malaysia and Saudi Arabia have taken root through foreign aid and Islamic Charities, and basically tipped traditional life on its head.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not everywhere, though. Some Chams are deeply suspicious of Islamic outsiders, and have accused them of effectively stealing fatherless children to send to overseas madrassas. Those suspicions are shared by Western governments but for very different reasons. They fear growing links between Chams and fundamental Islam could turn Cambodia &#8212; a country notorious for porous borders and under-resourced security &#8212; into a base for terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p>Much of the money donated to the Chams is coordinated through Cambodian non-government organizations (NGOs) that have paid generous fees to the government for the right to operate. Among the most prominent NGOs are the Cambodian Islamic Development Foundation and the Cambodian Islamic Youth Association, funded by aid flowing primarily from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Iran.</p>\n<p>In Phum Trea, foreign donations began trickling in about a decade ago when residents started following Dawa Dabligh, an orthodox brand of Islam practiced by some in Malaysia. Imam Mohamad says the mosque was financed by Muslims living in America while regular donations accompanied Dawa Tabligh visits from Malaysia. Other Cham leaders who have not converted say much of this funding can ultimately be traced back to Iran.</p>\n<p>The lure of overseas aid is hard to resist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Chams are the poorest of the poor, sit at the bottom of Cambodia&#8217;s social heap and are ripe for outside forces bearing gifts,&#8221; Says Blengsli. &#8220;Those who don&#8217;t convert must fend for themselves and they are scared and tired of being victimized.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To experience such feelings at first hand, travel about 50 kilometres west of Phum Trea to a village in Kampong Cham, the Cham heartland. Leaders of the 2,000-strong villagers, which sits in Roka Poprum commune, asked for it not to be named for fear of retribution.</p>\n<p>Unlike the people of Phum Trea, the traditional Chams here are terrified of Khmer authorities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Visits from the police are common,&#8221; the village chief says. He adds that ethnic and religious tensions have intensified since September 11, 2001, attacks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Boys are getting into fights and the situation for girls is impossible, so the parents have requested that their children be withdrawn from school. Since September 11 small problems have escalated into big problems,&#8221; he says.</p>\n<p>According to Nguen Meng Chhay, director of the Deik Dos primary school in Kampong Cham, there&#8217;s been a noticeable decrease in enrolments among the Cham since September 2001, with Chams increasingly sending their children to religious schools or keeping them at home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Those schools don&#8217;t teach the Khmer curriculum,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This will probably worsen the situation among the Chams.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Indeed education has turned into a flashpoint in the advance of the orthodox Islam in Cambodia. The people of the village in Roka Poprum commune are deeply suspicious of Islamic outsiders, particularly Arabs, who they say scout the countryside for orphans as well as fatherless children to send to overseas madrassas. Others share their concern about the impact of such education on young Chams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They study Islam and Arabic and not much else,&#8221; says Blengsli, the anthropologist. &#8220;They do not learn their native Cham and rarely their national Khmer language. Too me it&#8217;s disturbing if someone returns home and they can&#8217;t talk to their mum because of an orphan education.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The arrival of outside forms of worship is causing other tensions within Muslim communities. Earlier this year in Roka Poprum, Cambodia&#8217;s top Islamic leader, Mufti Sos Kamry, had to intervene after traditionalist and orthodox Muslim communities tried to shout each other down during prayer services. The mufti ordered that only one type of prayer session be agreed upon and held, but the row is till going on. Elsewhere in Cambodia, mosques are being split into two or second mosques are being built.</p>\n<p>To a large extent, the wider Khmer suspicion of the Chams is fuelled by rumors that they are planning to secede and re-establish the Cham kingdom of Champa, physically uniting Kampong Cham with the old heart of Champa in southern Vietnam. Such accusations gained credence after Cambodia discovered that for six months around the end of 2002 and early 2003, it hosted an unwanted guest, Indonesia-born Riduan Isamuddin &#8212; or Hambali &#8212; blamed for the October 2002 Bali Bombings that killed more than 200 people. Two Islamic schools were later closed, teachers deported and arrests made. Four alleged members of Jemaah Islamiah, a group associated with Hambali that advocates a pan-Asian Islamic state, remain in custody while prosecutors study their case.</p>\n<p><strong>TERRORIST HIDEOUT</strong></p>\n<p>Western security officials caution against painting a doomsday terror scenario. But they worry that Cambodia&#8217;s culture of impunity could be abused by militants in need of access to southern Thailand, which has witnessed Islamic unrest in recent years, or Malaysia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nobody seriously thinks life in Cambodia is in peril, that there&#8217;ll be any Bali-style bombings or that militancy and belief in a pan-Islamic state will threaten the country,&#8221; says one Western counter terrorist agent. &#8220;But it is a place for terrorists to hide out and take in a bit of rest and recreation. Hambali proved that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Concerns over in-roads by fundamentalists led the United States embassy in Phnom Penh earlier this year to issue a 68-page glossy magazine espousing the virtues of Islamic life in America. But the village chief in Roka Poprum says 85% of his villagers couldn&#8217;t understand a word of it &#8212; it was written in Khmer.</p>\n<p>But even if they could understand it, the document would struggle to make an impact on the hard-pressed Chams.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The only assistance on offer for these people is from an alien branch of Islam that wants conversions, and this is achieved with the blessing of the government after the fees are paid, and these people are unwittingly prone to militancy,&#8221; says Belngsli. &#8220;Those who hold on to traditional values go hungry, are bullied in school and are picked on by the police.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Back in Phum Trea, Mohamad is unimpressed by Muslims who fear the Khmer authorities and indifferent to the problems faced by traditional Chams since September 2001. Thanks to its benefactors, Phum Trea has electricity, the children are better educated and Mohamad is building himself a new home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problems are not for all the country,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I care only for my village.&#8221;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Backed by overseas wealth, conservative forms of Islam are taking rapid root among impoverished Cham Muslims.

The term prostitute is equally insulting and Rosie is uncomfortable.

He died in 1996 having never returned to his version of the exotic Far East. Two visits, the last in the early 1960s, were enough for Mason who feared the latter-day version of Wanchai would spoil his romantic vision of life and sin in a British colony.</p>\n<p>It was a convenient excuse. Life does change but the reality is Hong Kong has always measured prosperity by the number flies that swarm the rubbish &#8212; supply &#8212; against the number of prostitutes &#8212; demand. It&#8217;s all about money and getting as much of it as fast as you can in the world&#8217;s most celebrated consumer society. In any city prostitution is about as accessible as a tea bag. Where Hong Kong differs is in the marketing and Rosie&#8217;s concept of a barfly stems largely from Chinese attitudes to sex which blurs the line between prostitute and concubine.</p>\n<p>This is somehow more comfortable because Rosie says she is a Catholic.</p>\n<p>Wanchai is not Bangkok&#8217;s infamous Pat Pong Road. The girls here do not turn tricks with razor blades or ping pong balls with the same flair as a Romanian gymnast. In fact, on first sight they appear tame. Some tunes, polished mirrors and a small stage &#8212; where the girls perform a disco routine, clad in lingerie that never comes off. Mamasan can charge $45 HKD a beer for starters, and except for that who could really complain?</p>\n<p>The recipe underpinning this industry carries historical attitudes, beguiling Chinese contradictions which say girls are useless unless sex is involved. There is a quant Chinese definition for taking a virgin. Seducing a 13-year-old girl is &#8216;trying the flower&#8217; a year later it is &#8216;gathering the flower&#8217;. Polite enough for a medieval dictionary, perhaps, and then there&#8217;s the Chinese proverb: &#8220;Ten fine girls can not equal one crippled boy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prostitutes in China have never been treated with the same contempt as their counterparts in the West. As the lowest of the low the <em>mui stai</em> simply share their status with other women whose importance is garnered from the men they keep. On the mainland the communists have banned vice but traditions remain and especially flourish where Western capitalism has conspired with Asian characteristics.</p>\n<p>It provides an easy cover for Rosie. As a typical Filipino her background is Christianity of the Latin American brand and her society&#8217;s mores are strict in defining a whore. Being a prostitute at home is out of the question. Besides the relatives are always around the corner and the local church is down the road will take a dim view</p>\n<p>Why risk the embarrassment and it&#8217;s such a dirty business. But you can be a dancer and live as a barfly in Hong Kong on a short-term contract. Do it sort of legally, without moral posturing and at a safe distance from home. Perfect!</p>\n<p>She tells Rev the same story she told her mum. Rosie was hired by an agent in Manila on a six month contract as a dancer (no nudity) in Hong Kong. Food and lodgings are provided; she works a six-day week and is promised a small fortune from tips. The money she makes will enable her to complete a university education, set up a small business of her own, or make big inroads in alleviating her family’s poverty.ong Kong. Food and lodgings are</p>\n<p>Importantly, if Rosie decides she wants a boyfriend then this is at her discretion, therefore she rationalizes that she can not be a prostitute. However, the gulf between Rosie and the outside world is tremendous.</p>\n<p>Most people can only peer into Rosie’s life and make assumptions. It’s a zone where the saying “don’t knock it till you’ve tried it” doesn’t really stand up. At this level it’s not about bored housewives dabbling on the side, it is about very young girls from genuinely poor backgrounds whose fate rests solely on the ability of a system to exploit their sexuality.</p>\n<p>In the outside world is Mylinh Lee, an Australian girl who admits to being a feminist when it suits her. Vietnamese born of Chinese parents she works as a communications consultant in Hong Kong. Her heritage is important only because tedious stereotyping means horny cab drivers and drunken businessmen will assume she works the street, if she stands on a Wanchai corner for more than five minutes. They don’t see her background, Sunday at the football in Melbourne, cricket at the MCG, beach barbecues, a loving family and a good job.</p>\n<p>She believes for a girl to become a prostitute is to bounce across the last line of life. It is certainly not on her agenda. “Sex is like survival, it’s for procreation but for a woman it can mean children or the next meal, it’s like a commodity and most women have fantasised about it, particularly when they come out of a bad relationship which was based solely on sex.</p>\n<p>“They can be emotionally numbed and say to themselves, why not make money out of it and some con themselves that this is a win win situation.</p>\n<p>“But once you cross that line something inside you must effectively break, you turn your back on all previous relationships and what has made you what you are and then you open up on a new level, one where relationships are based solely on strangers, and you lose the sense of who you are. Life becomes a series of snapshots, a photo album where the present is captured but there’s no real link to the past or future. There is no background, no substance and I think that is very sad.”</p>\n<p>Mylinh’s perspective is important because it is honest and encompasses a subject where the lines of political correctness have taken hold. It’s not cool to sledge a working girl but hey if there’s nothing wrong with it says Dan Boylan how come I don’t want my mother or sister working as a whore.</p>\n<p>“If I had a daughter and she had the slightest thought of becoming a prostitute, why is it that I’d want to throw a chastity belt on her and lock her up for 30 years. There’s something inside you that says there’s something wrong but you can’t really say it’s wrong.”</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>cross the border they keep coming. The Pearl River Delta has four cities where the industry thrives. In Macau Russian blonds are traded by the mafia in Vladivostok with local triads. Guangzhou at the tip of the Delta provides a beachhead for mainland girls, from there the destination is often the frontier town of Shenzhen where Chinese girls are prepared as industry rivals for Rosie and the Russians in the old European colonies. The promise is to makes a year’s pay in just two weeks, however, some will stay in Shenzhen where the concept of the concubine is being reinvented and become mistresses or second wives to Hong Kong truck drivers who ferry through several times a week.</p>\n<p>Shenzhen is a mad house. The streets are lined with barber shops that double as brothels and dentistry’s which deliver capped teeth with the speed and finesse of a McDonald’s restaurant. The agenda of a future mainland prostitute is always to work in the rich cities of Hong Kong or Macau. Once in Shenzhen they work in the barber shops (with no scissors) offering a haircut, a massage, and a blow job for the locals. But the biggest problem is their teeth. A calcium deficient diet leaves them stained and slightly tanslucent which betrays their rural mainland background and provides an easy tell for wary customs officers. Once they’ve saved enough money a shoddy dentist will cap them.</p>\n<p>Between Hong Kong’s New Territories and Shenzhen lies a filthy river. It serves as the no-mans land which divides poverty and promised riches. The strip is heavily fortified, and the gun towers and razor wire tell the locals they are not welcome. In the days of Richard Mason, Shenzhen was a sleepy fishing village of a few thousand, today its population of four million stretch resources and frustrate the authorities who have been charged with the impossible task of holding China’s poorest at the gates of Hong Kong. As Boylan, who has written on the region since his days at the Tiananmen Square massacre puts it: No one was born here, everyone is from somewhere else, 10 years ago the local language was Cantonese now it’s Mandarin.”</p>\n<p>Fake passports or travel documents inevitably result in thousands sneaking through. It’s only a five minute walk from the barber shop to customs and then a two minute walk across the river where a train will deliver its passengers to Central station within an hour. Girls can also bribe two-way permit visas from local officials which allow them a short visit but legally they are not allowed to work.</p>\n<p>Enter author Kate Whitehead who has lived in Hong Kong since the 1970s and recently published <em>After Suzie: Sex in South China</em>. She does not complain nor judge to the point of being very correct. And she has interviewed scores of prostitutes, pimps, brother owners and triads.</p>\n<p>To cater for the vast numbers of incoming girls, Kate says, the seedier side of Hong Kong sleaze has moved across the harbour to Tsim Sha Tui and Mongkok where the laws of supply and demand mean the girls are a quarter of the price and in greater abundance than their peers in Wanchai.</p>\n<p>“In Wanchai it’s a tourist trap to the point where their competitors in Mongkok and Bangkok use the Internet to warn dedicated sex hunters to stay away,” she says. “It’s a great form of advertising.”</p>\n<p>Kate is very matter-of-fact and states bluntly that the sex industry fills a need but she concedes “it is all so sad” and this sadness stems from the denial and lifestyle which reality serves up after the girl arrives.</p>\n<p>“The girls make up stories about themselves to the point where I really don’t think they have a grip on reality. They all have a boyfriend, or regular client, someone who will take them away from all of this. They invent a new life which makes it easier.</p>\n<p>“The drugs are also a big thing that has to be supported. Right at the bottom is the heroin addict, at the top its cocaine, in the middle it’s amphetamines, and it all adds up to one thing. It creates an economic need and they can’t escape.”</p>\n<p>She says it’s an open secret that Hong Kong’s sex trade is controlled by triads. And triads you don’t mess with as Kate found out. She went into hiding once <em>After Suzie</em> was published where she wrote: “Aside from the top-class escort agencies almost all other areas of the sex industry, from karaoke bars to massage parlours have triad links. Whether the triads own an establishment, organize the recruitment of girls, or simply pay regular visits to collect protection money.”</p>\n<p>While it’s foolish to romanticise organized crime the triads do pale when compared with the Russian mafia in Macau. A few years ago a New Zealand lawyer fell in love with a White Russian prostitute and decided to marry her. The pimp agreed to let her go after consulting with girl’s agent in Vladivostok. The fee was arranged and both the lawyer and pimp travelled to Far East Russia where the payment was suppose to be made. Their bodies were found two days later. They had been executed gangland style with their hands tied and then shot in the back of the head.</p>\n<p>Their deaths were a very public warning that once a girl is on the game then that’s where she stays.</p>\n<p>“The triads have a notion of civility, the Russians, well you just don’t fuck with them,” Boylan says.</p>\n<p>Some do skirt the triads and the mafia and Joy is a case in point.</p>\n<p>She’s the type that would fit comfortably on a Penthouse centerfold. As an Italian blond she is also every bit the high class international hooker who charges $1,000 USD a night. She freelancers and flies around the world on a whim and loves it when men adore her body to the point where they pay. It’s a lifestyle which some magazines try and glorify and Joy likes that idea too.</p>\n<p>“I met a man once who tried to pick me up in a bar. At first I told him I was a model, and that was okay, then I told him I was a high class hooker. The minute he said that he pulled out a thousand US and I liked it, it turned me on.”</p>\n<p>For Joy the breast implants have long since paid for themselves but even her in your face – I can do whatever I like – attitude seems flawed.</p>\n<p>“I saw that guy again in the street and he ignored me. I wasn’t acceptable after he did what he did.”</p>\n<p>Then inexplicably she says: “You know I adore my mother and if she ever found out what I was doing she would die of shame. I know it’s an old line but an old prostitute once said to me once a whore always a whore.”</p>\n<p>On Kowloon side the money is not so good. Kate says there are more than 450 vice deans in Mongkok and the mamasan will take more than half. There’s the noodle shop which looks like a restaurant, the menu is Thai noodles ($25 HKD), Philippine noodles ($35 HKD), Malay noodles ($45 HKD), add a zero and order the girl of your preferred nationality. Here the margins are low but the income is bolstered by increased volumes, between 10 and 20 men a shift.</p>\n<p>In the back rooms, as Whitehead documented, some of the girls compare notes. Western men “have big weapons”, Chinese men are easy and undemanding, Europeans want to fall in love. There’s the middle class Americans who insists on showing family snapshots. There’s a happy wife and a couple of kids, it’s as if it is going to ease their conscience before they drop their pants a request some penance.</p>\n<p>Americans take too long. The Australian navy doesn’t come often enough. The Japanese are nice and quick. My pimp is squeezing me, mamasan takes the money and I can’t find my drugs.</p>\n<p>They also complain about the ‘chicks in Wanchai’ who they fear are better looking, more exotic and therefore command a higher price.</p>\n<p>Rosie is blissfully ignorant of this, after all she’s not a prostitute, she’s a barfly. Around her is half a dozen Australian Rugby League players. One pukes, another sings: “I’ve been to paradise but I’ve never been to … while others brag about their conquests of Russian girls in Macau and near death experiences with Macanese pimps.</p>\n<p>Rosie cavorts from behind the bar teasing the drinks with innocent poses while pretending to be a dancer. The club she works is indifferent to the others around the corner. There’s the Pink Pussycat, San Francisco, Fire House, Crazy Horse.</p>\n<p>Rev: So Rosie, it is a business and you sleep with men for money?</p>\n<p>Rosie: “No”, she fidgets again. “I told you I am a barfly – first I must like you.”</p>\n<p>“If I want to go out with you then first you must get permission from mamasan. If she agrees then it’s okay to go on a date. Would you like to meet mamasan? Then first you buy me a drink.”</p>\n<p>Behind the bar the girls continue to dance, shimmering up against a stainless steel pole, simulating a blow job towards a European who’s sniffing and picking his nose. He smiles, she winks, and initial negotiations are done. Meanwhile the German expat is chatting-up another hostess who sat down for a drink while Rev was entertaining the idea of buying Rosie for the night.</p>\n<p>Rosie asks Rev to buy her a drink. This costs $250 HKD for one plus 10%.</p>\n<p>Rosie gets $25 HKD, mamasan the rest.</p>\n<p>At this stage it becomes obvious that Rosie likes Rev very much and has invited herself home for the night. But first Rev must negotiate with mamasan. “Would you like to meet mamasan?” Rosie asks.</p>\n<p>“Nah, not this time, besides my partner would kill me and what would I tell my mum?”</p>\n<p>Rosie’s attentions are now focused on the German.</p>\n<p>In After Suzie, Kate argues that the frivolity of the Suzy Wong days – when Western men were lured by legend and the promise of Oriental beauties – are long gone and that the magic is wearing thin. Hong Kong still means Fragrance Harbour and perhaps the fragrance is gone.</p>\n<p>But the reality is that hatching an icon from a holiday and turning it into an international best seller was a tribute to Mason’s imagination.</p>\n<p>The romanticized version probably never really existed. But the intrigue remains in the denial and the truth somewhere behind Sino-Western facades and plastic teeth, Rosie will never admit it’s all about money.</p>\n<p>And Joy will always lament “once a whore, always a whore it doesn’t matter where or when.” That was a swipe at the days of Richard Mason.</p>\n<p>“The double standards and Western hypocrisy, I can never be accepted. I live in a closet.”</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Love is a Many Splendoured Thing was a fitting 1950s Hollywood tribute to romance.

About 800,000 people are thought to have died violently.</p>\n<p>There were no exceptions. Nuon Chea even once declined to intervene on behalf of his own nieces Lach Vary and Lach Dara – two Chinese trained doctors who worked for the Kampuchean health ministry and along with their husbands were dispatched to S-21.</p>\n<p>The trial of both men in Case 002 has been divided up into smaller hearings at the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC). In the first trial, Case 001, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, who ran the S-21 torture and extermination centre, was jailed for life.</p>\n<p>The current trial, 002/01 focuses on crimes against humanity and the forced evacuation of cities and towns immediately after the Khmer Rouge seized control of the country on April 17, 1975.</p>\n<p>Thousands died in the initial weeks. Hospitalized patients, like women who had just given birth, were marched alongside the entire population out of the capital and into the countryside. Those once loyal to the previous Lon Nol regime were earmarked for killing, or as Smith put it, these were “processed deaths that were well planned, managed and disciplined”.</p>\n<p>Up to 800 people could be clubbed in a day.</p>\n<p>Smith also cited minutes from meetings of the all-important Standing Committee which approved the evacuation without adequate food, water and medicine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a crime against humanity to send millions of people out into the hot countryside, to walk for days, weeks, sometimes months without any organized transportation or any provision of food, water or medical assistance,&#8221; Smith said.</p>\n<p>New People, as those from the cities and towns became known, were forced to live with Old People from the villages. Marriages were enforced en-masse between strangers, pretty young girls were given as trophy brides to favored cadre and troops who had been handicapped in combat and Muslims were forced to marry non-Muslims. Women who denied their husbands conjugal rights were killed.</p>\n<p>Schools were closed, all forms of traditional and modern art was banished, alongside money and religion. All vestiges of Cambodian life came to end as Pol Pot and his ultra-Moaists initiated polices to establish an agrarian utopia and wind the clock back to Year Zero.</p>\n<p>Significant was construction of a massive airstrip the Khmer Rouge built for Chinese strategic purposes. As many as 30,000 people are believed to have died at the site in central Cambodia. Suicides were common. Laborers chanced their luck with poisons or by leaping under a truck instead of carrying on.</p>\n<p>Every member of the Standing Committee had visited the site. One witness testified how Khieu Samphan had urged them to work harder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan killed for power. They spilt blood for it. They brutalized and dehumanized their own people and kept spilling blood for power,&#8221; Smith said, adding both had ordered others to do &#8220;their very dirty work&#8221; for them.</p>\n<p>Throughout both men stuck to a well-rehearsed defence strategy, accepted moral responsibility and even apologized to the victims for any suffering they might have endured during their rule.</p>\n<p>But neither accepted responsibility for the deaths of a quarter of Cambodia’s population.</p>\n<p>Nuon Chea blamed the in-coming Vietnamese alongside Vietnamese and American infiltrators for the deaths while Khieu Samphan argued he never wielded enough power within the Communist Party to be able to carry out such crimes.</p>\n<p>The pair are the last survivors of the Khmer Rouge Standing Committee &#8212; that wrote and deployed government policy – and are allegedly among those most responsible for the atrocities. Ieng Sary a former foreign minister died in March while his wife, Ieng Thirith, a former minister for social affairs was diagnosed with dementia and ruled medically unfit for trial.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors are demanding a maximum possible sentence of life imprisonment for both in a verdict that could be the last for the ECCC which has been shrouded by controversy ever since initial investigations began for Case 001 back in 2007.</p>\n<p>Allegations of political interference by Prime Minister Hun Sen whose government has been slow to fund its half of the tribunal, jobs for the favored few and the tortuously slow pace of the proceedings have at times threatened to overshadow the main event taking place in the court room.</p>\n<p>“I think the press has been worse than its total effect,” David Chandler, an academic and among the world’s foremost experts on the Khmer Rouge, said from Monash University in Melbourne. “The best thing about the ECCC is the mass of data that has accumulated, with no help from the government, about the Democratic Kampuchea era.”</p>\n<p>Investigations have been launched in Case 002/02 that could lead to an indictment of Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan on genocide charges. Trials are also in the offing for Meas Muth, Khmer Rouge navy commander in Case 003 and Prosecutors also want to try Im Chem a former district chief and deputy zone secretaries, Yim Tith and Aom An in Case 004.</p>\n<p>However, given the funding shortfalls and comments from Hun Sen stating that the current trial would also be the last, any future hearings are doubtful. A paper by the Open Society Foundation, released this week, urged all involved with the court to display honest leadership and to respond appropriately to the evident constraints on time, funding and political support that the ECCC now faces.</p>\n<p>Chandler, who was also called as an expert witness, said the legal process had been cumbersome. Nevertheless he was impressed by the foreign judges and prosecutors.</p>\n<p>“I was impressed by the reach and depth of the material in the closing order for the second trial,” he said. “I think the thousands of ordinary of people who came to watch the trial came away with some sense that something was being done.”</p>\n<p>More than 100,000 Cambodians have attended ECCC hearings, school curriculums now teach the Khmer Rouge period and television programs covering the tribunal have been a ratings success.</p>\n<p>Those associated with the tribunal are fond of saying that parents are no longer afraid to talk to their children about the brutalities that happened here almost four decades ago, and that the cost of finding some kind of justice for Pol Pot’s victims – at under US$200 million to date &#8212; was less than the cost of a bridge spanning the Mekong River.</p>\n<p>For those reasons alone the ECCC has its backers.</p>\n<p>As for Pol Pot’s surviving henchmen, Chandler added: “I hope they both die in prison &#8212; where they belong.” A verdict is expected mid next year.</p>\n<p><i>Luke Hunt can followed on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeanthonyhunt\" target=\"_blank\">@lukeanthonyhunt</a></i></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>BOMBORRA IMAGES &#8212;  A photo feature by Luke Hunt By LUKE HUNT / Phnom Penh In a courtroom on the flooded outskirts of Phnom Penh, a full bench of Cambodian and International judges has retired to <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/khmer-rouge-tribunal-case-001/\" title=\"Judges Retire in Khmer Rouge Case 002\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2011-07-03 16:27:26',8,2,14,'2011-07-03 16:27:26','2013-11-13 15:27:44'),(610,610,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Malaysia-0040LH.jpg','A Philippine Peace Process','a-philippine-peace-process','<figure id=\"attachment_611\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-611\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Malaysia-0040LH.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-611\" title=\"Malaysia 0040LH\" src=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Malaysia-0040LH-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-611\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Filipino Refugees in Kota Kinabalu</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Can the new Aquino administration broker a lasting peace agreement with the MILF in Mindanao? <a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/?page_id=98\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Hunt</a> and <a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/?page_id=101\">Karl Wilson</a> report for <em><a href=\"http://the-diplomat.com/2010/08/19/a-philippine-peace-process/\" target=\"_blank\">The Diplomat</a>.</em></p>\n<p>In a clearing just outside the southern Philippine town of Sultan Kudarat the leader of the country’s biggest Muslim group contemplates an uncertain future.</p>\n<p>After 40 years of conflict, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), hoped the new Philippine government of President Benigno Aquino would finally do what past presidents have failed to do—bring peace to this south-eastern corner of the Philippine archipelago.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Can the new Aquino administration broker a lasting peace agreement with the MILF in Mindanao?

Another 16 counts were yet to be ruled on in the November 23 Maguindanao massacre. Breathtaking!</p>\n<p>Alleged ring leader, Andal Jr has been charged with 56 counts of murder, one shy of the 57 victims, because one body has not been identified.</p>\n<p>Clan members charged are Andal Snr, Andal Jnr, Zaldy, Akmad, Anwar, Sajid, Jimmy, Kanor, Bahnarin, Mama, Saudi, Ulo, Ipi, Harris and, Moning. They all share the same family name.</p>\n<p>In evidence already submitted to investigators, Kenny Daladag quoted Andal Snr as saying: “If the Mangudadatus pass by, kill them all, even the children, don’t leave anyone alive.”</p>\n<p>Daladag was a member of Senior’s private army and the comments were made on the eve of the massacre in the patriarch’s home.</p>\n<p>The Department of Justice has also found probable cause to charge Maguindanao police officers for alleged foreknowledge of the massacre, their failure to stop it and alleged participation by some officers.</p>\n<p>The massacre was the biggest single slaughter of journalists in history.</p>\n<p>Bail hearings had been postponed following a slew of motions filed by lawyers on behalf of Andal Jnr and Saudi. This includes a defense motion asking Quezon City Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes to remove herself from hearing the case because of alleged bias.</p>\n<p>Andal Snr was the governor of Maguindanao while his son Zaldy was governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARRM). They were close allies of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The other Ampatuans also held government positions in the provinces of the ARMM.</p>\n<p>They were charged with killing members of the rival Mangudadatu clan who were on their way to Shariff Aguak to file a certificate of candidacy for Buluan Vice Mayor Esmael Mangudadatu who intends to campaign for the governor of Maguindanao in upcoming elections.</p>\n<p>This would have pitted him against Andal Jr.</p>\n<p>Mangudadatu’s wife Genalin, two sisters and an aunt were killed along with the journalists, lawyers, supporters and innocent motorists who happened to be on the highway. More than 100 armed men allegedly led by Andal Jr. stopped the convoy and carried out the killings.</p>\n<p>Amid the legal shenanigans the Ampatuan family has rejected reports that they were offering out-of-court settlements to relatives of the victims. Blood money is not uncommon in this part of the world.</p>\n<p>Philip Pantojan, lawyer for the Ampatuan family, said he would not advise his clients to take such action as it would indicate °guilt&#8221; and talk of a settlement may have stemmed from complainants having doubts about the guilt of his clients.</p>\n<p>However, outgoing Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera said relatives of most of the victims in the massacre were not keen on accepting such offers.</p>\n<p>Devanadera reportedly said she had talked to relatives of the victims, and most of them remain determined to seek justice as opposed to accepting blood money.</p>\n<p>Further afield and on an improved note, Iran has released on bail four journalists and a retired professor held since a December 27 protest, the semiofficial Iran Labour News Agency reported.</p>\n<p>Abdolreza Tajik, Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, Behrang Tonkaboni and Mohammad Javad Mozafar, who is also a prisoners&#8217; rights activist, were released alongside retired professor Mohammad Sadeq Rabani.</p>\n<p>Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Doulatabadi also announced that &#8220;detainees of recent unrest will be released due to the upcoming Iranian new year,&#8221; which falls on March 21.</p>\n<p>In Lagos, sports journalist who thought their craft some what safer than their cousins covering politics are thinking again. Gunmen there have kidnapped three sports journalists working for an African satellite channel in the Niger Delta.</p>\n<p>The SuperSport journalists, including two Nigerians and one South African, were near Warri on their way to an airport when they were attacked.</p>\n<p>SuperSport journalist and announcer Charles Anazodo told The Associated Press that the South Africa-based sports network had yet to receive a ransom demand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On their way back to another match venue, they were robbed.

They died in 25 countries, and represented an increase of 33 percent from a year earlier, according to a report released by the Press Emblem Campaign.</p>\n<p>It said the killings in the Southern Philippines marked the “worst massacre of journalists in history,” when 31 were killed in November during an attack on an electoral convoy in Maguindanao province.</p>\n<p>“On average 10 journalists were killed per month by armed groups, criminal groups, governments and in terrorist acts,” Blaise Lempen, the group&#8217;s secretary general, said.</p>\n<p>“Others were kidnapped or exiled and in many cases silenced while impunity continues.”</p>\n<p>The Philippines had the highest media casualty numbers, and together with Mexico, Somalia, Pakistan, Russia and Iraq, accounted for two-thirds of the casualty count in 2009.</p>\n<p>In Mexico, 13 journalists were killed as the battle against drugs and trafficking intensified. Another nine were killed in Somalia, caught in the cross fire and by terrorist attacks.</p>\n<p>Calgary Herald reporter Michelle Lang was the last to die, killed alongside four Canadian soldiers by a massive explosion in Afghanistan on December 30.</p>\n<p>In Russia, seven journalists were slain due mainly to the conflict in the Caucuses while some improvements were observed in Iraq compared to 2003-2007. Six journalists died there in 2009.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) is investigating allegations that its regional office had been giving special treatment to the four detained Ampatuan clan members, charged in connection with the November 23 Maguindanao massacre.</p>\n<p>Philippine National Police Director General Jesus Versoza ordered the investigation following the Philippine Daily Inquirer’s report the detainees were allowed to use their mobile phones, and had their cooks and maids on hand to feed and clean their cells.</p>\n<p>Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao governor Zaldy Ampatuan and his younger brother Sajid were among the four while dad, Maguindanao Governor Andal Ampatuan Sr,. has been hospitalized.</p>\n<p>Andal Jnr, a local mayor, was also among them.</p>\n<p>Military officials said the clan were not receiving anything special but were simply being given the attention that fits a wounded soldier from battle. The poor things.</p>\n<p>Major Randolph Cabangbang, spokesperson of the Eastern Mindanao Command, said Andal Sr has been “treated as a detained patient who receives the same food as our sick soldiers.”</p>\n<p>“If he wants to order out, it is from his own pocket,” Cabangbang said.</p>\n<p>And that’s not special treatment at all.</p>\n<p>The Junta in Burma has been up to its old tricks. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has thrown some light on the harsh sentencing of Hla Hla Win, a broadcast journalist with the Oslo-based Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB).</p>\n<p>She was sentenced to 20 years in prison on December 30 for violating the vague and draconian Electronic Act.</p>\n<p>The CPJ said Hla Hla Win was first arrested on September 11, 2009, on her way back from a DVB reporting assignment in Pakokku Township where she conducted interviews with Buddhist monks in a local monastery.</p>\n<p>According to DVB editors, she was working on a story pegged to the second anniversary of the 2007 Saffron Revolution, when Buddhist monks rose up against the military-run government in countrywide protests which were violently suppressed.</p>\n<p>On October 6, a Pakokku Township court sentenced Hla Hla Win and her assistant, Myint Naing, to seven years in prison for using an illegally imported motorcycle.</p>\n<p>After interrogations in prison, they were both subsequently charged with violating Section 33 of the Electronic Act, which forbids unauthorized use of electronic media and is increasingly used by the regime to punish journalists and activists for sending information out of the country.</p>\n<p>Hla Hla Win now faces a combined 27 years in prison for her reporting activities.</p>\n<p>“Burma’s military government says that it is moving toward democracy, but at the same time continues to punish journalists with harsh sentences,” said CPJ’s Southeast Asia senior representative Shawn Crispin.</p>\n<p>“Before the international community rewards the regime for holding ostensibly democratic elections this year, it should demand demonstrable progress on press freedom, including the unconditional release of Hla Hla Win.”</p>\n<p>On the other side of the ledger, Chinese journalist Li Junqi has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for taking bribes to help cover up a coal mine disaster.</p>\n<p>As the Hebei bureau chief of the Farmers Daily he was apparently among a number of journalists who were paid about 380,000 US dollars by mine officials.</p>\n<p>The officials are also accused of moving bodies and destroying evidence after a July 2008 explosion in which 34 miners and a rescue worker were killed.</p>\n<p>Nine more journalists are to be sentenced, and at least 48 officials also face charges of paying or taking bribes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile The Vietnam Journalists’ Association (VJA) has condemned attacks on three of its members.

But at least there were some forward thinking journalists on hand at Xinhua who followed up on death threats being issued against correspondents almost a year after the worst massacre in Philippine history.</p>\n<p>The Chinese news agency reported from Cotabato that several Filipino journalists in the southern Philippines, including a photographer for Agence France Presse (AFP), had simultaneously received death threats earlier this month.</p>\n<p>It said Mark Navales, a stringer photographer for AFP, confirmed he was among those who received the threat after an unknown man sent a message to his mobile phone advising him to watch out for the media death squad.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is alarming. Whatever circumstances, we don&#8217;t want last year&#8217;s mass killings to happen again,&#8221; Navales said.</p>\n<p>Xinhua said Navales had informed his colleague, Ali Macabalang, head of the Bureau of Public Information of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, who also received the same message.</p>\n<p>The threats came as a lawyer described Zaldy Ampatuan as a gentler, kinder Ampatuan.</p>\n<p>Lawyers made the claim on behalf of the family head and former governor for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao after witnesses blamed the Ampatuans for the massacre of 57 people including 30 journalists, and relatives of their clan’s politicals rival last year.</p>\n<p>“Among friends and family members, Zaldy was always known as the gentler and kinder Ampatuan who is loving to his family, a doting father, a good husband and a religious man who made his pilgrim trips to Mecca,” lawyer Redemberto Villanueva told the courts.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the former governor also said that he was with then President Gloria Arroyo when the massacre was committed.</p>\n<p>Zaldy said he and then Congressmen Yusop Jikiri and Munir Arbison, and other political leaders of Sulu province, were with Arroyo discussing how the administration could resolve the 2010 electoral contests in the province of Sulu.</p>\n<p>In occupied Kashmir, journalist forums have condemned the recent seizure of newspapers and beating of journalists and photographers by Indian policemen and paramilitary troopers in Srinagar.</p>\n<p>Kashmir Journalists Corps (KJC) and the Kashmir Press Association said in separate statements that high handedness by intelligence agencies against the media in the Kashmir valley had resulted in a pattern of beatings and harassment.</p>\n<p>Still in Central Asia and Western forces occupying Afghanistan are facing similar claims of harassment after three journalists were detained, prompting an angry reaction from advocates around the world.</p>\n<p>The Associated Press reported that NATO had released Mohammad Nadir, a television cameraman for al-Jazeera, and Rahmatullah Naikzad, who worked for both al-Jazeera and The Associated Press.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After reviewing the initial intelligence and information received during questioning, the two men were not considered a significant security threat and were released,&#8221; said Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, communications director for the NATO-led military coalition.</p>\n<p>Similar tales were dispatched by Paris-based Reporters Without Borders which has condemned an attack that wounded an anchor at state-run TV across the border in Iraq.</p>\n<p>A bomb was attached to his car.</p>\n<p>The media watchdog group also cited three recent incidents during which it said Iraqi reporters, photographers and cameramen were roughed up by security officials.</p>\n<p>In one, the group says journalists were forced to lie face down on the ground while being beaten and insulted by police at a Baghdad checkpoint following a political event.</p>\n<p>Continuing the border hop into Iran and a prominent reformist journalist has been sentenced to three years in prison and an Iranian-Canadian blogger was sentenced to 19 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Journalist Isa Saharkhiz, 56, was sentenced after receiving the maximum penalty of two years for insulting Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and another year for issuing propaganda against the regime.</p>\n<p>During last year’s disputed elections he campaigned for reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi.</p>\n<p>Apparently covering the world’s tougher stories is all a bit much for some. Especially in Australia where doing it a bit rough excuses the odd indulgence, so say friends of Peter Lloyd the former South Asia correspondent for the ABC who was jailed in Singapore for buying ice.</p>\n<p>Pete has his job back.</p>\n<p>Speaking up on behalf of his mate, colleague Tim Palmer said he could not believe the risks some reporters took with alcohol and drugs while overseas and that at least half a dozen reporters at the ABC could have easily faced the same fate as Lloyd.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But Pete, I&#8217;d always observed, was either working until two in the morning or getting an early night &#8230; he would have been the last on my list,&#8221; Palmer told a local magazine.</p>\n<p>Lloyd agreed with Palmer&#8217;s comments about himself that he was a hard working bloke, telling the same local magazine that he was &#8220;the boring guy&#8221; during his time overseas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In Bangkok, it&#8217;s a pretty wild city and I was the boring guy who went home in a world of journalists who stick s&#8212; up their nose all the time,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Thanks Pete, I’m sure your colleagues in Thailand will appreciate that one.</p>\n<p>Lloyd – guess what? He has a book out called <em>Inside Story</em> &#8212; said he only used the drug ice twice in his life to recover after being on difficult assignments, like the Bali bombings (2002) and the tsunami (2004).</p>\n<p>Yet the poor thing was caught buying ice four years after the tsunami.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[The drug] was very zhooshy. Straight away, and for the next few days, I had a period of clarity, no nightmares.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Whoopi doo!</p>\n<p>Lloyd served seven months of his 10-month sentence after being caught buying methamphetamines in July 2008. He avoided a more serious trafficking charge, which carried a sentence of fifteen lashes and 20 years in prison. As we all know drug traffickers can be executed in Singapore.</p>\n<p>Of all the difficult assignments to befall the thousands of journalists who went to work over the last decade, Lloyd obviously did it tougher to the point where he could justify self-medicating himself on ice, which he acquired in – of all places &#8212; Singapore.

It also wants passage of the Freedom of Information Bill, which the House of Representatives has failed to ratify.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is our view that a robust and independent media sector is essential to democracy and assurance of respect for universal human rights. However, the long-running culture of impunity surrounding the deaths and violent assaults and intimidation of Filipino journalists pervades the Philippines, and is a significant impediment to the full realization of these rights,&#8221; IFJ said in an open letter.</p>\n<p>In Africa, Nigeria is providing one model for monitoring unwanted people in the trade, while the Taliban in Afghanistan are doing what they think is their level best as well.</p>\n<p>In Nigeria, people are fed-up with people posing as journalists.

A lynch mob was filmed clubbing, stoning and then killing three members of a minority sect in front of police, before laughing at their limp, shattered bodies. The US Ambassador issued a statement deploring the religious violence, just three months after President Obama lauded the secular democracy’s “spirit of religious tolerance.”</p>\n<p>The 3,000 police deployed during the trial of Islamic cleric and accused terrorist mastermind Abu Bakar Ba’asyir will be authorized to use live ammunition to control unrest. In Papua New Guinea, where 4,000 road accidents occur each year, a specialized task force found over 90 per cent of vehicles in the border province of Sandaun were unroadworthy. Thugs wearing ninja masks threatened locals in East Timor.</p>\n<p>The Philippine government is hopeful of success in its twentieth attempt at peace negotiations with the country’s main Islamic militant group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). India and Pakistan agreed to resume peace talks halted after Pakistan-based militants attacked Mumbai in 2008.</p>\n<p>Twenty thousand people fled their homes during fierce fighting between troops and militants in the Pakistani tribal region of Mohmand, a long serving sanctuary for the Taliban and al-Qaeda. In Afghanistan, a Taliban commander was revealed to have spent the past three years controlling an active cell of suicide bombers from inside Kabul’s main maximum-security prison. At the direction of the Taliban, a teenage suicide bomber dressed in a school uniform blew himself up in an army compound in Pakistan; at least 31 people were killed. A second autopsy was conducted on the body of a 14-year-old Bangladeshi girl who died a week after publicly receiving 80 lashes as punishment for allegedly having an affair with a married man. Although the original autopsy recorded no injuries, the second autopsy discovered she had in fact bled to death. A new law in Afghanistan demands women seeking refuge in shelters justify themselves to an eight-member government panel. The women will face an interview, physical examination and virginity test before a determination is made as to whether they should be granted refuge, returned home or sent to jail.</p>\n<p>The Indian navy and coastguard captured 28 Somali pirates who had spent the last 11 months occupying a Thai fishing trawler carrying 24 fishermen. India’s tabloid media declared on of Tibetan Buddhism’s most revered incarnate lamas a Chinese spy. He was arrested by Indian police with $1 million in his home and subsequently accused of plotting a monastic empire along the border region. A secretly shot video showed one of China’s most high-profile human right activists, Chen Guangcheng, being held under house arrest. Authorities accuse the self-taught lawyer, who is blind, of carrying out forced abortions. A father was reunited with his kidnapped son after nearly three years of separation courtesy of a three week old Twitter-style account that has proved widely popular in China, where some of the 60,000 children abducted every year.</p>\n<p>Manga comics came under the scrutiny of Japanese public officials, who called for tighter restrictions on the provocative depictions of young girls in popular publications like “My Wife Is an Elementary School Student.” A Chinese sexologist estimated that 80 per cent of China’s gay population marries straight people. Hong Kong’s McDonald’s stores began trialing $129 McWedding packages, which include a personalized menu, McDonald’s themed gifts and a lone fry replacing the traditional cherry a couple shares prior to kissing.</p>\n<p>Anti-whaling campaigners labeled whale hunters an endangered species, claiming Japanese public opinion had tipped against the industry. Tensions between Russia and Japan continued to soar after President Medvedev ordered military chiefs strengthen defenses of the disputed Kuril Islands. Medvedev described the islands, located six nautical miles north of the Japanese island of Hokkaido, as an “inseparable” part of Russia. A lingering territorial dispute over an ancient cliff-top temple led to fierce fighting between Thai and Cambodian soldiers. South Korea continued to seek an apology from the North for the sinking of a South Korean warship in March last year, which resulted in the death of 46 sailors. North Korea rejected talks with South Korea, which had “sinister” motives of “unreasonable” demands. Interviews with North Korean defectors revealed that skinny jeans, adult films and human excrement were selling like “hot cakes” on the regime’s black market.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>A looks at the headlines making news this week from around South-east Asia  and a little bit beyond.

Yudhoyono inaugurated a ‘Peace Gong’ to symbolize peace and pluralism whilst protestors clashed with police outside the ceremony.</p>\n<p>An Indonesian Commander denied allegations the military had masterminded riots that led to the burning of Churches: “It’s not true. TNI never does such things such as orchestrating a conflict in the interest of a certain group or individual. We are neutral.” Less than three months after he was sworn in, a top member of Myanmar’s junta resigned from Parliament without offering an explanation. The junta’s role in the newly elected but military-dominated government remains unclear. The Australian editor of a Myanmar newspaper was arrested and jailed for violating immigration laws. Chinese censors blocked US diplomats’ attempts to create online debate about internet freedom, less than 24 hours after US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched an initiative to help dissidents protest online. The government maintained Chinese internet users enjoy freedom of speech “in accordance with the law,” whilst Chinese computer servers were linked to cyber attacks on Canadian government institutions.</p>\n<p>Eleven foreign tourists and their Vietnamese guide drowned after their tour boat sank in waters in the north-east of the country. In an effort to increase career opportunities, a northern Indian Dalit (formerly known as ‘the untouchable’) community is building a temple to worship the Goddess of the English language, whilst in Bangladesh the 10<sup>th</sup> Cricket World Cup was launched following a USD30 million opening ceremony. During a UN speech in New York, the Indian Foreign Minister read out the Portuguese Foreign Minister’s text for over three minutes before realizing his error; he explained the mistake by saying many UN speeches were basically the same. Kim Jong-un, the heir apparent to the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, cemented his position as the second most powerful person in the country when he was named vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission. The announcement preceded a celebration for the elder Mr Kim’s 69<sup>th</sup> birthday festivities, crowned by a vast turnout of goose-stepping soldiers and uniformed women dancing amongst glowers known as kimjonilia. The leader broke a promise of a day’s food to all of the country’s 24 million people. Television images showed both Kim’s at an art show in Pyongyang; both men wore black pants, identical oversize cargo coats and matching brown fur hats. North Korea complete a launch tower for its new missile base, a key step in efforts to test a missile that could eventually reach the United States.</p>\n<p>The Malaysian government campaigned to stop Muslims celebrating Valentine’s Day, labeling it a ‘trap’ that could encourage immoral behavior.

The Chinese government continued to arrest and censor those linked with a so-called “Jasmine Revolution” of silent demonstrations.</p>\n<p>Authorities cracked down on those “inciting subversion of state power” with several well-known human rights activists badly beaten and key internet search phrases blocked. Protest-related searches on the US Ambassador to China, Jon Huntsman, remained authorized; the possible 2012 US Presidential candidate was criticized for attending one such rallies.</p>\n<p>There is no sign of a winter of discontent in neighbouring North Korea either, despite drastic food shortages caused by the longest the longest consecutive stretch of freezing temperatures since 1945. Officials in Seoul saw no signs of unrest in the reclusive regime where social media does not exist.</p>\n<p>By comparison, Indian police were shown on national television hitting dozens of cricket-lovers’ legs and backs as they queued for tickets to a World Cup match between India and England.</p>\n<p>Indonesian human rights groups accused their government of failing to uphold the law after 13 Muslim hardliners received extremely light sentences for an attack on a Protestant Church congregation. The day prior the Religious Affairs Minister had claimed “liberal thought” was infecting the nation and that Indonesian students studying philosophy abroad needed to stay away from liberal Islam as, “Ultimate freedom belongs to Allah only.” Meanwhile, and in a somewhat contradiction, a Religious Affairs Ministry official blamed rising intolerance among local religious communities on a lack of government funds to promote religious harmony.</p>\n<p>Malaysian recruitment firms said a burgeoning market for maids had arisen following an Indonesian decision 19 months ago to bar its citizens from taking new jobs as domestic workers in Kuala Lumpur. Thirty-five thousand Malaysian families are waiting for domestic help, whilst in East Timor the government planned to regulate the cost of basic needs in an effort to avoid price rises.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>India’s economy continues to grow at an enviable nine per cent a year, courtesy in large part to an insatiable desire amongst the consumer cars for mobile phones, cars and large homes. Despite this impressive performance and a strong push by multinational corporations into developing nations, foreign investment in India fell more than 31 per cent in 2010. Outsiders blame corruption and bureaucracy for the shift away from India, highlighted by a massive US$1.4 billion in foreign investment being pulled from the country’s stock market in the last two months.</p>\n<p>Japan may have yet another short-lived government, with Prime Minister Naoto Kan struggling to maintain public support for his eight-month old leadership ahead of a crucial budget battle.

Although there were no protests of any discernible size, government authorities introduced more stringent restrictions on what foreign journalists could report.</p>\n<p>Beijing is also focused on the upcoming National People’s Congress, where agenda items will include tax increases on gas-guzzling cars, improved food safety and tougher penalties for drunken driving. It was also announced that the national defence budget would increase by 12.7 percent in 2011. This came as Japan was forced to scramble jets into action after two Chinese military aircraft flew close to disputed islands in the East China Sea.</p>\n<p>After a month of questioning by intelligence agencies, 27 North Korean fishermen who accidently crossed into South Korean waters will be repatriated to the North. Four fishermen defected, joining more than 20,000 defectors in the South.</p>\n<p>India’s Supreme Court forced the chief of the national anti-corruption watchdog to resign after he was accused of fraud dating back to 1992. His resignation is the latest in a series of corruption scandals to hit India’s ruling Congress party.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there were lavish celebrations for an arranged marriage between the children of two other prominent Indian politicians. The week-long wedding saw the groom wear a garland made of bank notes and the gifting of a helicopter. Not to put a damper on the nuptials, but figures released also showed a drastic change in Indian divorce rates recently, with a 100 percent increase in the past five years alone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Pakistani Taliban claimed credit for the assassination of former minorities minister Shabaz Bhatti, who was a prominent Christian who campaigned against Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws. Christians protested across the country, condemning the killing and denouncing the blasphemy law – which carries a death sentence for anyone who insults Islam.</p>\n<p>In Indonesia’s West Java, authorities have restricted the activities of a small Islamic sect called the Ahmadiyah through a decree limiting members’ ability to publicly identify themselves and urging them to convert to mainstream Islam. Despite the Constitution enshrining freedom of religious expression, the government has been under pressure from hardliners to ban the sect completely.</p>\n<p>Such religious animosity was wiped off the Indonesian front pages, however, by an equally powerful force – soccer. Hundreds of protestors took to the streets in Jakarta to demand the resignation of the beleaguered Football Association of Indonesia’s chairman, whom they say has run Indonesian soccer into the ground.</p>\n<p>The suicide rate of Japanese people unable to find a job jumped 20 percent last year, according to figures released this week. Such pressure to perform also saw a 19-year-old prospective student arrested after he posted questions of Kyoto University entrance exams on the internet to solicit answers. The case sparked a scandal in the Japanese education sector and spurred a national manhunt.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>A look at the headlines making news this week from around South-east Asia  and a little bit beyond.

Last week’s massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami destroyed the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant’s backup power system, sending temperatures soaring and triggering fears of a meltdown.</p>\n<p>There were increasingly ominous signs in the emergency. Radiation levels were described as “extremely high,” unexplained white smoke billowed from damaged reactors and officials warned spent fuel rods could be on the verge of spewing radioactive material. Despite seven days of desperate efforts, including waterbombing the troubled reactors using military helicopters, the reactors failed to cool.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the death toll from the quake and tsunami continued to climb inexorably. Authorities estimated the number of dead at 10,000. Around 440,000 people took refuge in evacuation centres or makeshift shelters where they encountered bitterly cold temperatures and shortages of food, fuel and water.</p>\n<p>All the while, aftershocks kept people across northern Japan on edge. Many foreign nations extended the recommended evacuation zone in advice for its citizens, whilst others accused Japanese officials of failing to provide enough information and downplaying the potential catastrophe. Europe’s Energy Commissioner said the word “apocalypse” was appropriate to describe Japan’s nuclear crisis.</p>\n<p>China suspended approval for the construction of new nuclear power stations. It is currently constructing 27 new reactors, equal to about 40 percent of the total number being built worldwide.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the region’s other news, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao undertook a charm offensive in India this week, promoting what Wen called “cooperation, not competition,” between the two nations. India has received an enormous amount of international attention in recent months, with US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicholas Sarkozy all having visited the economic powerhouse.</p>\n<p>The Indian media, however, was largely preoccupied with the Wikileaks release of US diplomatic cables on the world’s largest democracy. Of the most controversial were cables detailing how politicians had revealed “cash for votes is a way of political life in South India.” When surprised US Consulate-General officials asked about the legality of such practice, they were told, “Of course, but that’s the great thing about democracy.”</p>\n<p>A Tibetan monk reportedly burned himself to death to protest against China’s occupation of Tibet. While China’s state media reported that the hundreds of protestors rallying in Sichuan province prevented the 28-year-old monk from receiving hospital treatment, Tibetan rights groups reported that witnesses saw police extinguish the flames and then beat the monk to death.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>A  look at the headlines making news this week from around South-east Asia  and a little bit beyond.

In Beijing they’re jumping at their own shadows in response to the protests that have toppled rulers in the Middle East while thugs in Indochina have come out to play.</p>\n<p>The Chinese government is threatening to expel foreign journalists as the Jasmine Revolution left dear leaders doubting how much their people actually liked them. Bloomberg&#8217;s Stephen Engle was beaten while others were detained.</p>\n<p>Foreign journalists were also read the riot act and harassed by security forces for turning up at small gatherings of people. Warnings were issued that correspondents risked having their visas revoked and the authorities again revealed how their thin skin.</p>\n<p>Gilles Lordet, research coordinator for Asia at Reporters without Borders, says China has increased its control over the media and critics since human rights activist Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It shows the nervousness of the government about demonstrations, about the possibility of that the demonstrations in the Middle East can have an impact on a network of human rights defenders, journalists and defenders of freedom of expression in China,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In Burma It had to happen. Nobody expected the Burmese junta to let the good times roll once last November’s “elections” were done. But I thought the focus of their paranoia would again be pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>\n<p>Instead, authorities arrested Australian publisher Ross Dunkley, who is anything but <em>The Lady</em>, and thrown him behind bars in Rangoon’s notorious Insein Prison.</p>\n<p>His February 10 arrest followed a story by <em>The Irrawaddy</em> magazine about an internal power struggle at Myanmar Consolidate Media, publisher of the heavily censored weekly <em>Myanmar Times</em>.</p>\n<p>Dunkley is co-founder, the other is Swezon Media Group. According to <em>The Irrawaddy</em> an acrimonious split emerged at the paper. This was shortly before Dunkley&#8217;s arrest for a visa violation and allegedly molesting a woman. The woman told the court she wants the charges dropped but police have refused to oblige.</p>\n<p>Dunkley is also publisher of the <em>Phnom Penh Post.</em></p>\n<p>David Armstrong, Chairman of Post Media which publishes the <em>PPPost</em>, was deeply concerned.</p>\n<p>He said the arrest “coincides with tense and protracted discussions Mr Dunkley and the foreign ownership partners in the <em>Myanmar Times</em> have been conducting with local partners about the future direction of the publishing group, ownership issues and senior leadership roles.”</p>\n<p>The Overseas Press Club of Cambodia (OPCC) added increased authoritarianism is a growing trend in many countries around the region, while free press advocates from across South-east Asia and further afield were also worried.</p>\n<p>The arrest of Dunkley, a free trade advocate &#8212; who is currently out on bail &#8212; speaks volumes for the bullying of a junta that believes November elections were also grounds for the dropping of sanctions against it.</p>\n<p>Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has opposed the lifting of punitive measures, prompting Burma&#8217;s state media to warn that Suu Kyi and her party will meet tragic ends if they keep up their support of Western sanctions.</p>\n<p>Suu Kyi noted this during a recent audio conference from Rangoon with correspondents in Kuala Lumpur.</p>\n<p>“I am not certain exactly why Ross Dunkley has been arrested but certainly one thing I can say is that there is no freedom of the media yet in Burma and it helps if people try to expand the limits of what journalists can do in Burma,” she said.</p>\n<p>She adds even Burma cannot escape 21st Century technology that has significantly expanded the ability of people to organize without government interference, a major factor behind the protests in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>“Those who know about those events are comparing what’s happening there with what happened in Burma 1988 &#8230; Everybody is waiting around to see with great interest what transpires because people were impressed with what happened, particularly in Egypt.”</p>\n<p>In Indochina they&#8217;re doing it tough. Le Hoang Hung, a 50-year-old Vietnamese journalist who was set on fire while sleeping has died from his injuries.</p>\n<p>Hung had worked for <em>The Worker</em> covering the southern Mekong Delta and earned himself a reputation for investigating official corruption. According to reports he was scheduled to cover a court case involving a local official being sued for misappropriation of land.</p>\n<p>Hung’s wife was sleeping in another room when an intruder broke into their home and doused him with chemicals. Minutes later he was alight.</p>\n<p>“The whole family was sleeping and all of a sudden I heard my husband screaming,” she told a local news portal. They threw water on the flames and rushed him to hospital where he died 10 days later.</p>\n<p>This can’t compare with the comparatively mild shenanigans that occur in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>But the real fear is that Cambodia could be losing its luster as a haven for the free press.</p>\n<p>In the early 1990s the United Nations arrived, so did the NGOs, the Phnom Penh Post and the OPCC. The authorities appeared tolerant of journalists who knew their own mind.</p>\n<p>As such eyebrows were raised when Om Yentieng, head of the government’s anti-corruption unit and the</p>\n<p>Cambodian Human Rights Committee, confiscated tapes from journalists after a recent press conference he had given.</p>\n<p>He objected to questions about a grenade attack on opposition supporters in 1997 when 16 Cambodians died and more than 100 people were injured. Nobody has been held responsible.</p>\n<p>Government spokesman, Phay Siphan, later said officials had the right to confiscate recordings if the questions create trouble. He also noted officials had a right to protect their privacy and dignity.</p>\n<p>What this had to do with questions surrounding the 1997 grenade attack is anybody’s guess and the OPCC noted Om Yentieng’s actions were incompatible with three Cambodian laws and its constitution which guarantees press freedom.</p>\n<p>The confiscations followed an incident where police injured photographer Sovan Philong from the <em>PPPost</em> and confiscated his camera. He sustained minor injuries while Hong Menea, an apprenticed photographer, also had his equipment taken.</p>\n<p>They held government press cards and were documenting evictions around Boeung Kak lake in Phnom Penh and their gear was returned after their photos were deleted.

At least 42 journalists were killed worldwide in 2010, with Iraq, Mexico, and Honduras just behind Pakistan according to the Committee to Protect Journalist.</p>\n<p>China and Iran also stood out, by pushing the number of journalists imprisoned worldwide to its highest level since 1996, with 145 reporters, editors, and photojournalists identified by the CPJ as being behind bars on December 1, up by nine from the 2009 tally.</p>\n<p>Eritrea was third among the foremost jailers of journalists.</p>\n<p>Among the dead, six of the eight Pakistani journalists were killed in suicide attacks or in crossfire during militant strikes. Such attacks injured more than two dozen other Pakistani journalists over a year when Afghanistan, Thailand and last year’s standout – The Philippines &#8212; also made unwanted contributions.</p>\n<p>Rather glibly, the report reads like an annual profit and loss statement from a major corporate.</p>\n<p>This year’s number is an improvement from 2009 when 72 died, however, the numbers are slightly misguiding.</p>\n<p>The sharp drop was partially attributed to last year’s figures being extraordinarily high with 32 journalists killed among 57 people murdered in a single massacre in the town of Ampatuan in Maguindanao province. It was the country&#8217;s worst political killings blamed on the powerful Ampatuan clan.</p>\n<p>Efforts by recently elected President Begnino Aquino to launch investigations into those murders, separate from current ongoing legal action, and the record number of killings of journalists and human rights workers that occurred under his predecessor Gloria Arroyo have met with stiff resistance within the bureaucracy she left behind.</p>\n<p>This included her appointments to the Supreme Court bench.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has already declared the executive order creating a Truth Commission to specifically try corruption cases committed during the Arroyo administration as a violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p>In separate hearings the court has already thrown out petitions lodged against Arroyo’s son &#8220;Mikey&#8221; who is seeking another term in the House of Representatives on the party list system as representing his country&#8217;s security guard industry and tricycle drivers.</p>\n<p>The court has also issued warnings in regards to subjudice about bringing the institution &#8212; that’s the Supreme Court &#8212; into disrepute.</p>\n<p>All this has proved a bit much for Senator Francis Pangilinan (and more than a few others) who has urged the Supreme Court to rise beyond personal dictates.</p>\n<p>“How on earth can we legally and morally say that a son of a former President can represent a party-list organization for security guards? He does not represent security guards. Even a third grader can tell you that,’’ Pangilinan told the local press.</p>\n<p>“He (Mikey) represents his mother and their family and their personal and political interests, and the Supreme Court expects us to accept and respect its decision saying it isn’t so and he truly represents the marginalized security guards sector?’’ he asked.</p>\n<p>Whether Pakistan can fare any better in probing why so many of its journalists died this year remains to be seen. According to the CPJ report about 40 percent of all deaths in 2010 took place in combat and other dangerous circumstances.</p>\n<p>The CPJ added: &#8220;Suicide bombings and crossfire in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Thailand, and Somalia accounted for the unusually high proportion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With the number of freelancers growing amid the digital age alongside Internet based journalists it should not be too surprising to see an increase in contributions from each of those categories in the CPJ death and imprisoned toll.</p>\n<p>“At least six journalists who worked primarily online were killed in 2010. Internet journalists rarely appeared in CPJ’s death toll until 2008, when online reporters doing front-line investigative work began to be targeted with violence.”</p>\n<p>Sadly the CPJ is unlikely to be the last word on murdered and jailed journalists for the year.</p>\n<p>Since the report was released Muhammad Khan Sasoli became the fourth media professional to be killed in Pakistan in less than two weeks. Sasoli worked for Royal TV and the INP news agency in Khuzdhar and was a president of a local press club. Two men on a motorcycle shot him outside his home.</p>\n<p>Indonesian journalists are demanding a full investigation into the death of Alfrets Mirulewan, chief editor of the <em>Pelangi Weekly</em>, who had gone missing and was later found dead with bruises on much of his body.</p>\n<p>And Filipino journalist Edison Flamenia was shot dead while walking home in Labangan. Flamenia was writing for the Mindanao Inquirer in the country’s troubled south. On a brighter note, Randy Makiputin, a commentator for the Radyo Abante was shot in the head by assailants on motorcycles but survived.</p>\n<p>Updates by other media monitoring organizations will no doubt deliver a fuller result.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, hearty congratulations to the US state department, that great bastion of free speech.</p>\n<p>No sooner had Wikileaks founder Julian Assange been arrested than it dispatched the following press release:</p>\n<p>“The United States is pleased to announce that it will host UNESCO&#8217;s World Press Freedom Day event in 2011, from May 1 &#8211; May 3 in Washington, D.C. UNESCO is the only UN agency with the mandate to promote freedom of expression and its corollary, freedom of the press.</p>\n<p>“The theme for next year&#8217;s commemoration will be 21<sup>st</sup> Century Media: New Frontiers, New Barriers.”</p>\n<p>How appropriate given the precedents set by Washington’s hysterical pursuit of Assange, perhaps a more appropriate host of the next World Press Day should be found.

Luke Hunt writes for <em><a href=\"http://the-diplomat.com/asean-beat/2011/05/12/reach-sambath-1964-2011/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Diplomat</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 1990s, he earned his stripes as the journalist ‘who got on the chopper first’ when Cambodia’s warring factions went into battle. Later on, he emerged alongside his most affable compatriots as his country began stitching together a peace. Sambath, sadly, passed away Wednesday after a massive stroke. He was 47 (we think).</p>\n<p>When I began as bureau chief for Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Cambodia on July 1, 2001, Sambath’s exploits had already lent him an air of superiority. With his great friend Ker Munthit at Associated Press, the pair had formed the formidable local backbone of the international press corps in Cambodia. They survived the Khmer Rouge, and got themselves educated in Cambodia and abroad before going on to tell the noble truth.</p>\n<p>By the time I arrived, Sambath had just returned from the United States where he had completed a scholarship for advanced journalists at Columbia University. He held the best contact book in Cambodia and a love for the job that was unsurpassed, matched only by the size of his big Khmer heart.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On only our third day on the job together, a bomb was detonated inside the Hong Kong Hotel on Monivong Boulevard. It was a wet and miserable day and Monivong was then a bog of red clay. We arrived just minutes before a second bomb went off about 130 feet away.</p>\n<p>Sambath didn’t flinch as others dropped into the mud. Fastidiously clean, the idea of ruining a perfectly pressed shirt just wasn’t acceptable to him. Two people were dead and another seven wounded. Quickly and calmly, Sambath led our small group to shelter in case there was a third bomb.</p>\n<p>Such stories were common among my predecessors Matthew Lee, who helped build the roof on Sambath’s family home, and Sheri Prasso, who initially hired him back in 1992.</p>\n<p>That calmness, however, often masked a heightened sensitivity.</p>\n<p>At times, Sambath was deeply frustrated by the asinine coverage of Cambodia that was occasionally offered by journalists looking for a sensational headline to please an editor and a by-line from the Killing Fields to appease his or her ego.</p>\n<p>The same could be said for editors in Hong Kong and Bangkok, who liked to think Cambodia was simply an extension of Thai foreign policy and were prone to making horribly wrong assumptions. That thinking is evident in the coverage of the conflict at Preah Vihear today. They lacked respect.</p>\n<p>Sambath even once chided Hun Sen for not giving him enough respect. They met for the first time after his return from the United States and Sambath told me within earshot of a standoffish prime minister: ‘He thinks I’ve been tainted by foreign influences.’</p>\n<p>Nothing could have been further from the truth.</p>\n<p>Sambath could be prickly as he juggled a family life with the hard and fast dictates of a wire service while also moonlighting as a university lecturer and for some of the world’s great mastheads.</p>\n<p>His favourite gigs were with Seth Mydans at <em>The New York Times</em>, although the list of journalists with whom he shared a cold beer, many more laughs and his political insights, was endless. Among them: Michael Hayes, Hurley Scroggins and Seth Meixner—all of <em>The Phnom Penh Post</em> at some point—and <em>The Cambodia Daily’s </em>long-serving editor, Kevin Doyle.</p>\n<p>In the early days, the idea of a Khmer Rouge tribunal scared Sambath. He wasn’t opposed to the idea of justice—both his parents were killed by Pol Pot, and he loathed the Khmer Rouge who orphaned him. As a result, I don’t think Sambath ever knew his real birthday or his true age.</p>\n<p>This is a point too often lost on Cambodians who grew up abroad, and long time observers whose incessant and sometimes hysterical demands of the tribunal to deliver on <em>their</em> sense of justice scare the daylights out of the very people they claim to represent.</p>\n<p>Sambath genuinely feared a tribunal would lead his devastated country back to war, and revenge was never in his book. He spent a disproportionate amount of his time getting journalists out of trouble and was the only person I knew who could calm and cajole an irate Hok Lundy, the much feared bully and former National Police Commissioner.</p>\n<p>His attitude to the tribunal, like many Cambodians, did eventually change after years of arduous negotiations evolved into the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) and the surviving leaders of Pol Pot’s 1975-79 rule were charged and remanded. In time, Sambath warmed to the ECCC and eventually embraced it whole-heartedly.</p>\n<p>He would leave AFP and work an array of media institutions including the New York-based Independent Journalism Foundation, before joining the ECCC as Case 001 got underway with Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Duch, in the dock.</p>\n<p>As the fortunes of justice fluctuated, Sambath rose to the occasion, serving the courts as chief of public affairs. I will always cherish the smile on Sambath’s face that day last year when Duch<a href=\"http://the-diplomat.com/2010/08/04/revisiting-the-killing-fields/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was found guilty</a> and jailed for crimes against humanity and the extermination of his compatriots.</p>\n<p>Sambath was a man of many moods, happiest and best when taking charge of his students at the Royal University of Phnom Penh or spending an afternoon as host for the thousands of men and women who were trucked from remote kampongs to the ECCC, where they witnessed the trial process first hand.</p>\n<p>In his final hours, doctors were preparing him for a medical evacuation to Thailand. But in the end, Sambath died where he belonged—in Cambodia. He leaves behind a wife, Chhoy</p>\n<p>Chanthy, three children—Champaradh, Rithvong and Samboreak—an indebted nation and a generation of young Cambodian journalists who he inspired. He was also my friend, and I will miss him.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>As a war correspondent, Reach Sambath was among the bravest. Luke Hunt writes for The Diplomat.

It is the first of its type constructed in Borneo by Malaysia dedicated to the fallen from all nations in World War II.</p>\n<p>North Borneo was a British colony, only joining Sarawak, Singapore and the Malayan federation on Sept 16, 1963.</p>\n<p>As such responsibility for war graves and memorials in this part of the world has remained almost solely under the auspices of Canberra and London.</p>\n<p>Some like Dr Kamarulnizam Abdullah, Associate Professor of Strategic Studies and International Relations at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, believe that this war memorial represented much more to Malaysians, particularly in light of the  country’s sometimes tense relations with the West.</p>\n<p>He said recent trips by Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak to the United States and Europe – where formal ties were established with the Vatican – and the deal struck between Australia and Malaysia involving the processing and resettlement of refugees were enormous strides designed to improve Malaysia’s standing.</p>\n<p>“I look at the war memorial in Sandakan and see the more larger picture.</p>\n<p>“It shows a kind of warmer relationship between Kuala Lumpur and Canberra,  a sign that I think we haven’t seen for the last 20 years.</p>\n<p>“I think that Najib in general has tried to, you know, produce a good relationship with the Western powers,” he said.</p>\n<p><strong>Added urgency</strong></p>\n<p>In recent years Australia has led a concerted effort to clean-up and renovate Allied war memorials scattered around Malaysian Borneo and this is important for the thousands of Australians who come here every year to remember the fallen.</p>\n<p>And this has taken on an added sense of urgency given that the ranks of surviving veterans are thinning.</p>\n<p>Just two made it to Sabah for the unveiling, Roy Atkinson who is eighty-eight and former Lance Corporal Keith Ireland, also eighty-eight.</p>\n<p>Ireland remembers well the great destruction by the allied bombings ahead of the invasion of Borneo and coming ashore with a great sense of trepidation.</p>\n<p>But he said the troops had held it together because of their training and values – a sense of mateship, honour and a toughness in adversity.</p>\n<p>“Out of the 150 who joined there are only four of us left, which is, as we are getting to that age of nearly the 90 mark, I suppose we’re doing pretty well.</p>\n<p>“The only trouble with diminishing numbers is it’s something that we should not forget.</p>\n<p>“Ah, be like the ode, we will remember them and so you’ve got to stick to that and stick to what a lot of our chaps fought for and put our lives through and surely you can think of that, which is a great thing,” he said.</p>\n<p>Those sentiments were echoed around Sandakan Park yesterday as the Sandakan Liberation Monument was unveiled by Chief Minister Musa Aman, in honour of Atkinson and Ireland’s fallen comrades.</p>\n<p>ENDS</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; A memorial to honour Allied troops who died fighting to liberate North Borneo from Japanese occupation towards the end of World War II was unveiled in Sandakan on Sunday.

Our reporter filed this dispatch from </strong><strong>India.</strong></p>\n<div>\n<p>Refugee advocates in southern India say that people smugglers and some Sri Lankan Tamils will be rejoicing at a recent decision reached by the Australian High Court.</p>\n<p>The Court ruled the Gillard Government’s controversial asylum seeker swap deal with Malaysia unlawful, which has put into doubt about the future of off-shore processing – a policy principle also supported by the Opposition.</p>\n<p>Many of the 72,000 Tamil refugees living in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu closely watched developments relating to the Gillard Government’s controversial asylum seeker swap deal with Malaysia. Tamil refugee advocate A Elamurugan says the High Court decision will result in more refugees attempting to make the perilous boat journey to Australia.</p>\n<p>“People smugglers and refugees are very aware of what is happening in Australia,” says Mr Elamurugan, who has oversight of 36 internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in the Erode region in southern India.</p>\n<p>“Refugees will definitely welcome this decision because for them it means they will be settled in Australia if they make the trip. For people smugglers, it means they can make more money.”</p>\n<p>People smugglers have proved extremely successful at sending people to Australia by boats through what is known as the ‘Sri Lanka-India pipeline’. Since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war in 2009, Tamils have accounted for a large proportion of those asylum seekers who landed on Australian shores.</p>\n<p>That success is in large part due to the Tamil Diaspora in Australia, according to Chennai-based journalist AS Panneerselvan. Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are keenly aware of the latest policy and legal developments thanks to their family and friends in Australia.</p>\n<p>“There is a cross-class affinity in the network,” Panneerselvan explains. “This network passes on all the information that the refugees need to know.</p>\n<p>“It is a porous information flow. Each element of the law is explained. They have known about the Malaysian agreement and watched it closely.”</p>\n<p>The people smugglers will also be quick to begin readvertising their services in the 115 camps across Tamil Nadu, according to SC Chandrahasan, the founder of the Organisation for Eelam Refugee Rehabilitation (OFERR).</p>\n<p>These people smugglers are Indians and within the IDP camps they usually have networks of sub-agents, who are also refugees.</p>\n<p>“These sub-agents will very quietly approach people who are looking to travel to Australia,” Mr Chandrahasan explains.</p>\n<p>“They will then do all the go-between arrangements, which protects the larger agent if anyone is ever caught.”</p>\n<p>OFERR officials say that direct travel from Sri Lanka has become immensely difficult because of increased surveillance by its government. Refugees now either travel to south-east Asia by air, where they will then find a boat, or they will travel direct from India.</p>\n<p>To pay for the trip, the prospective passenger will save money and sell every possession he owns. He – and they are mostly young men – will also borrow from friends and family, some Australian-based.</p>\n<p>“Once they return to Australia they will then work to repay the cost of the journey. They will send the money back to the people smugglers,” says M. Sakkariyas, OFERR advocacy director.</p>\n<p>Boat ventures are shrouded in secrecy to avoid the Q Branch’s camp intelligence officers discovering the plans, making it difficult to pin down the exact modus operandi of the people smugglers.</p>\n<p>However, it is known that a refugee will usually pay a deposit of around two lakh ($4,300). Once he receives word of the impending departure, he will take a leave pass from camp officials and travel to a cheap hotel near the departure point.</p>\n<p>“The passengers will wait at this cheap hotel until the vessel is ready,” explains Mr Sakkariyas. “Then, in the middle of the night, they will get on the boat and go to Australia.”</p>\n<p>The dangers of travelling to Australia are widely known, and not just because of the Christmas Island boat tragedy, says Kolathur TS Mani, the president of Tamil political party Periyar Dravidar Kazagam.</p>\n<p>“I have heard of three ships disappearing,” says Mr Mani. “We presume they have sunk. The last one disappeared nine months ago.</p>\n<p>“But the agents also often steal money. I had one lady tell me that her son had lost one lakh ($2,150) to an agent, but the agent used a fake name so we could not find him again.”</p>\n<p>Mr Mani explains that, despite the risks, people continue to want to travel to Australia or another western country, like Canada. The allure of ending up with a better life will always draw them in, he says.</p>\n<p>“The camps are very unclean, dangerous,” says Mr Mani, a former LTTE supporter. “And the Indian government only provides each refugee with a meagre 13 rupees to live on each day.</p>\n<p>“That is not enough to survive on. But they can’t return to Sri Lanka because they are afraid they will be arrested or killed. So they look to go to Australia or Canada or Europe.”</p>\n<p>Other advocates, particularly those from OFERR, deny the poor conditions in the camps and it is difficult to verify the conditions, as even the UNHCR is not permitted entry.</p>\n<p>According to the Mr Panneerselvan, whilst the Gillard Government’s Malaysia policy was showing initial signs of “stopping the boats,” it was an appalling agreement.</p>\n<p>“It is clear that the basic seeds were laid by John Howard and Alexander Downer,” he says. “But these refugees are desperate to flee and nothing will stop them.</p>\n<p>“It’s bullshit for the Australian government to invoke a reason like environmental issues or being too crowded to refuse to take a couple of thousand refugees.</p>\n<p>“To refuse a refugee is to support their nation’s dictatorial regime.”</p>\n</div>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8211; The High Court’s decision to reject the Government’s asylum seeker swap deal with Malaysia was closely watched by Tamil refugees.

But what are the consequences of holding the government to ransom, asks AsiaWATCH from the Indian city of Chennai (Madras).</strong></p>\n<p>Since August, India has been captivated by the anti-graft movement led by campaigner Anna Hazare. Millions were galvanised by the self-styled Gandhian’s hunger strike, which two weeks ago forced the Indian government into an embarrassing back down over its proposed anti-corruption legislation.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, a campaign over competing pieces of legislation might seem too arcane to stir such intense passions. But in a country where corruption is so pervasive, Mr Hazare’s hunger strike struck a chord. It inspired similar anti-graft protests across the sub-continent, including in the laid-back coastal city of Chennai, where they were kick-started by senior High Court lawyer, K. Ravi.</p>\n<p>“We’ve had four successful campaigns in Chennai, involving officers of the highest rank and the commonest of common people,” Mr Ravi said. “Chennai is a laid-back city that wouldn’t normally budge for anything like this.”</p>\n<p>Although the anti-graft movement has managed to muster widespread support, many of Mr Hazare’s supporters will admit to knowing only the basic differences between the rival anti-corruption proposals.</p>\n<p>And compared to the international protests of recent months, the differences being argued over were actually quite modest. Both proposals will create a new watchdog, but the government balked at suggestions the prime minister and judiciary should be included in its purview. They were also reluctant to usurp the powers of the 28 Indian states and include lower level bureaucracy in the watchdog’s oversight powers.</p>\n<p>After 291 hours of fasting, however, the Indian parliament finally relented and announced it supported Mr Hazare’s bill, known as Jan Lokpal. It’s yet to be passed into law.</p>\n<p>For the government, this back down is made all the crueller because it was its own mishandling of the septuagenarian that propelled him further into the national spotlight.  It was only after Delhi police arrested the Mr Hazare on August 16 that his anti-corruption campaign really gained traction.</p>\n<p>“The second freedom struggle has started,” he said at the time. “Time has come, my country men, when there should be no place left in jail in India.”</p>\n<p>Although the government quickly forced his release, an emboldened Mr Hazare warned that he would fast until his death unless the government supported his anti-corruption bill by August 30.</p>\n<p>That ultimatum was supported by thousands of Indian protestors, including 31-year-old film director Appu Indravelu. He has been involved in Anna Hazare’s ‘India Against Corruption’ movement for the last eight months, but it was only when his family saw this “national hero” embark on a hunger strike that they decided to be part of history.</p>\n<p>Appu and his elderly father, with the support of Appu’s mother, joined the protestors housed at a crowded raised platform located on a chaotic Chennai street. Whilst Appu’s father ended his fast after four days due to a heart condition, Appu continued his hunger strike for a further six days, only stopping after Delhi-based protest leaders asked the strikers to redirect their energies.</p>\n<p>“We are ready to give our lives for this,” he says. “We needed this legislation to be passed in order to stop the corruption that is endemic in our country.”</p>\n<p>Compared to other defiant rallies that are so ingrained in India’s stable and vibrant democracy, Mr Hazare’s campaign has the overwhelming support of a public immensely frustrated by widespread corruption. Indians speak of having to pay bribes to receive a birth certificate or connect electricity.</p>\n<p>“There is even one famous example where a campaigner bribed an official to write an arrest warrant for the Prime Minister,” said Chennai local Sridhar Laxmanan.</p>\n<p>It is the popularity and doggedness of Mr Hazare’s campaign that  forced the government to rethink its approach, which had up until this point included describing Mr Hazare as “corrupt from head to toe”.</p>\n<p>Mr Hazare’s strategy of holding the government to ransom does have its critics, who argue that he is a threat to democracy. Indian journalist and commentator AS Panneerselvan views the Hazare bill creating another bureaucracy for a government already overly burdened by authoritarian institutions.</p>\n<p>“[Mr Hazare] is the ultimate fascist,” he says. “He is dictating our democratic process. His proposed bill doesn’t consider corporate corruption and it takes a guilty until proven innocent approach to those investigated. There is nothing in Lokpal about corporate corruption nor any disincentive for those who pay the bribes.”</p>\n<p>There is no sign that Mr Hazare intends to stop campaigning. As he broke his fast with a few sips of coconut water and a spoonful of honey, the veteran campaigner promised the 85,000-strong crowd that he would be back for more struggles.</p>\n<p>Journalist Gokul Vannan from the <em>New Indian Express</em> described the success of Hazare’s protest as a “dangerous trend for India”, although – like everyone we interviewed – he agrees that the endemic corruption is a sign of the general decay in Indian governance.</p>\n<p>“When you have a campaign this successful, it will make more people attempt to supersede parliament,” he says.</p>\n<p>But others see it as just another part of Indian democracy. Srijana Mitra Das, one of Anna Hazare’s celebrity supporters, defended the protests.</p>\n<p>“This is a democracy. Everyone has a right to protest. This protest was entirely peaceful, no force was used,” he told a press conference.</p>\n<p>“All bills are passed with political pressure and corporate lobbying. Several interested parties get involved. So what is wrong if the people of this nation &#8211; its most interested party &#8211; put pressure? Everyone lobbies. This time, the people are lobbying.”</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH&#8211; Anti corruption campaigner Anna Hazare’s hunger strike captivated the Indian public and left the government reeling.

So have Vietnam and Malaysia, which also uses its dealings with sand as a political bargaining chip when negotiating with the island state.</p>\n<p>Countries further afield are also thinking twice about selling sand to Singapore. Its surface area has expanded by 22% from 582 square kilometres in the 1960s to 710 square kilometres in 2008 and it wants to go much further.</p>\n<p>This was the case with Cambodia, which acted on a report by environmental activist Global Witness released in May and announced it had ordered the suspension of sand dredging while it assesses alleged damage to fish stocks and the ecology of the Tatai River.</p>\n<p>This came after a moratorium was imposed on sand exports in 2009.</p>\n<p>However, companies flouted the order and were continuing to dredge for export, and out of the Tatai River system, where limited dredging for local purposes was allowed, according to government officials and media reports, while smuggling elsewhere in the region also remains rife.</p>\n<p>A year ago, 34 Malaysian civil servants were arrested for accepting bribes and sexual favours in relation to sand smuggling and at that time former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad claimed 700 trucks a day were being loaded with sand and crossing Malaysia&#8217;s border into Singapore.</p>\n<p>SM Muthu, a council member of the Malaysian Nature Society and an adviser to the Sabah Environmental Protection Association, said the smuggling of sand into Singapore was continuing and there was no reason to doubt the figures provided by the former leader.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Smuggling is with the knowledge of certain authorities because nowadays in countries, especially in Southeast Asia, everything has a price.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s illegal, so there are certain people who are paid to look the other way, so they solve the problem that way,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>He said he had previously investigated complaints of illegal sand mining only to be told by Malaysian authorities this was not the case, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p>In Cambodia, at least 14 firms had been given dredging licences and NGOs have accused them of dredging in protected areas of the Peam Krasop wildlife sanctuary and Koh Kapik Ramsar site in addition to the Tatai River.</p>\n<p>Additionally Global Witness has claimed senators Mong Reththy and Ly Yong Phat &#8211; dubbed the King of Koh Kong &#8211; were covertly awarded licences to dredge sand.</p>\n<p>Mong Reththy has denied exporting sand to Singapore and claims he only conducts dredging to allow for the passage of ships to his private sea port.</p>\n<p>But according to a copy of a permit obtained by the Phnom Penh Post, the Ly Yong Phat Group &#8211; which has interests in casinos, hotels and plantations &#8211; has exclusive rights to sand dredging on the Tatai river until September next year.</p>\n<p>Global Witness said miners had penetrated protected mangrove, estuary and sea grass areas, breeding grounds for marine life along a coastline harbouring much of the country&#8217;s last wilderness areas. UN figures show Cambodia supplied 25% of Singapore&#8217;s total imports in 2010.</p>\n<p>The Tatai empties into the South China Sea, home to many rare species including the Irrawaddy dolphin and the dugong. From here barges can sail 1,280km direct to Singapore, which insists it acquires sand only from approved sources but has declined to identify them.</p>\n<p>Other reports say vessels belonging to Hong Kong-registered Winton Enterprises and Malaysian company Benalec Holdings were ready to meet orders from Singapore for sand from Cambodia. It costs US$3 (90 baht) a tonne to extract and is then sold in Singapore for $26 a tonne.</p>\n<p>In Phnom Penh, Ho Mak, the director of Rivers at the Ministry of Water Resources, said the companies dredging the Tatai River &#8211; also an eco-tourism area &#8211; had been ordered to stop after restrictions were announced by Prime Minister Hun Sen.</p>\n<p>Piech Siyon, a provincial director of the Department of Industry, Mines and Energy, insists this has happened; however, Chum Sok Korb, the deputy director of the Tatai Krom Eco-Tourism Association says the dredging is continuing and the villagers are suffering from depleted fish catches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Small boats still come to pump the sand in the river; we want them to move sand dredging operations as far away from the eco-tourism area as possible,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are afraid of losing the beautiful tourism area.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Villagers along the Tatai River live a hand to mouth existence and have witnessed widespread damage to their environment.</p>\n<p>Mr Muthu said such a scenario was typical of the problems caused by illegal sand mining across Southeast Asia. &#8220;I have seen houses already in the water. I have seen houses perched along the banks just waiting to sink into the rivers. It&#8217;s quite bad because these people do not care,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have laws but they are only on paper, in terms of practical enforcement it&#8217;s almost nil. They are all political statements &#8211; at the end of the day they just give in to those who are looking for cheap sand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of sand smugglers in Southeast Asia and the Singapore land developers are well aware of this, prompting accusations by Greenpeace they have launched a &#8220;war&#8221; for the commodity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Indonesian government has very strong reasons to stop sand exports to Singapore and imposed bans, which are still in place, during the administration of Megawati Sukarnoputri,&#8221; said Keith Loveard, a security consultant with Jakarta-based Concord Consultancy.</p>\n<p>He said as a result Singapore was known to have bought a lot of sand from Cambodia and Vietnam, but sand mining for export to Singapore has also continued in Indonesia. Sand mining is also being expanded into the Philippines, and to Burma where it is impossible to keep track of operations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I witnessed one operation on the southern coast of Belitung Island, about a day and a half&#8217;s sail from Singapore, where bulldozers were ripping up pristine beaches and stacking the sand onto barges,&#8221; Mr Loveard said.</p>\n<p>In Indonesia, the navy says it is capable of guarding only 12 islands &#8211; less than an eighth of the maritime islands along its border with Singapore and Malaysia. Of these, only 31 are inhabited.</p>\n<p>This prompted officials in Jakarta to recently urge provincial governors to be more vigilant in protecting the islands from smugglers.</p>\n<p>Mr Loveard also said there were allegations that sand mining for use in Singapore&#8217;s construction industry and landfill projects was threatening the existence of at least one island, Nipah. &#8220;Mining not only damaged fragile environments but also threatened to become an issue in Indonesia&#8217;s boundary disputes with Singapore. Extensive reclamation in Singapore could arguably have affected the placement of international boundaries including the exclusive economic zone.&#8221;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; Dredging and mining for use in Singapore&#8217;s construction industry and landfill projects are ravaging coastal ecosystems around the region, Luke Hunt reports.

Luke Hunt reports.</p>\n<p>Under Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organisation Muslims were expected to rise up and support the agenda.</p>\n<p>That included an Islamic caliphate covering much of Southeast Asia to be established under local affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) with Indonesian cleric Abu Bakar Bashir at the helm.</p>\n<p>He had been piecing JI together with Abdullah Sungkar, who died two years earlier, and was already proven in the art of terrorist tactics _ wanted in connection to simultaneous church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas eve in 2000, and strikes on the country&#8217;s stock exchange.</p>\n<p>Bashir bowed to bin Laden while Riduan Isamuddin _ popularly known as Hambali _ won a seat on al Qaeda&#8217;s leadership council based in Afghanistan. The strikes on New York and Washington by 19 hijackers, nearly all from Saudi Arabia, were a cause for celebration.</p>\n<p>In a post 9/11 world, the JI leadership set about asserting their demands through bombing campaigns which scared the daylights out of ordinary people. The impact was felt at every level of society.</p>\n<p>A counter-terrorism industry was spawned. Biometric access control systems became the norm, with private military contractors, advisers and guards bolstering security at government buildings and airports where tight travel restrictions became the bane of everyday travellers.</p>\n<p>Refugee flows also changed after the US led the &#8220;Coalition of the Willing&#8221; invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia became the transit hubs for thousands of people fleeing war zones to countries such as Australia.</p>\n<p>Perceptions of Islam were harshly altered and the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; provided an excuse for paranoid governments to crack down on any perceived threats, often with US support.</p>\n<p>Kamarulnizam Abdullah, associate professor of strategic studies and international relations at Malaysia&#8217;s Kebangsaan University, said 9/11 served as a wake-up call for policy makers in the US, forcing them to refocus on Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Previously, Southeast Asia was neglected by policy makers,&#8221; he told Spectrum.</p>\n<p>He said Muslim majority countries like Indonesia and Malaysia had to weigh up their foreign policy needs and an alignment with the US against the demands of a domestic politics where Washington and its Western allies had long been vilified as enemies of Islam.</p>\n<p>Indonesia was slow to respond. But that changed as the JI bombing campaigns intensified with the massive suicide attacks of Oct 12, 2002, on tourist bars and restaurants on the popular Indonesian island of Bali, that left 202 people dead.</p>\n<p>US and Australian advisers were dispatched to Indonesia and the Americans significantly expanded their reach in the southern Philippines where JI had established bases and forged a close relationship with the cutthroat Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (Milf) which had spent decades fighting for an independent homeland.</p>\n<p>In Cambodia, a dramatic reappraisal of relations with the local Muslim community was launched after it was discovered that Hambali _ mastermind of the Bali bombings _ had found sanctuary there among the normally moderate ethnic Chams who were converting to Wahhabism.</p>\n<p>Wahhabism, which counted bin Laden among its adherents, was introduced by firebrand missionaries from Saudi Arabia through charities that arrived after Cambodia&#8217;s civil wars drew to a close in 1998.</p>\n<p>Chhorn Eam, the Cambodian deputy minister for cults and religions, said relations had since normalised and Chams were free to study in Saudi Arabia where they learn Arabic and how to recite the Koran.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some come back with different beliefs such as using a piece of cloth to cover their face,&#8221; he said, adding concerns remain. &#8220;What we are worried is that they might bring something that would cause problems in general society and their communities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hambali was eventually captured across the border in Thailand. But in the country&#8217;s South near the Malaysian border a Muslim separatist rebellion was launched in January 2004 which the authorities in Bangkok have struggled to quell and has so far cost the lives of more than 4,700 people.</p>\n<p>Mr Abdullah said rebels in southern Thailand were of a similar ilk to the Milf as they were fighting for an independence that was wrapped up in Islam, alongside political rights and a sense of ethnic pride and this was providing the authorities with another set of issues.</p>\n<p>In countries like Malaysia _ where JI was founded by Indonesian fugitives and exiles _ Indonesia and Singapore, the use of internal security acts and controversial detention powers had enabled the authorities to weed out terror cells and substantially reduce JI&#8217;s ability to network, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Terror attacks were like a mirror of Islam in Asia,&#8221; Mr Abdullah said.</p>\n<p>Throughout Southeast Asia, mosques were divided between the moderates and those that became venues for the fiery orators _ Islamic militants and their students who openly supported, funded and carried out a jihad against all things Western.</p>\n<p>Mohan Malik, professor of Asian security at the Asian-Pacific Centre for Security Studies in Honolulu, said the US had endured setbacks in countries like Pakistan, which has been transformed from an ally to a battleground in the war on terror and this was also reshaping relations with India and China.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of the impact of 9/11 on Southeast Asia, I think old insurgences and separatist movements in southern Thailand, southern Philippines and Aceh were all clubbed with terrorist organisations and they suffered a major setback.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Indonesia&#8217;s government was forced to act against JI and that was a positive development for Indonesia and others in the region,&#8221; Mr Malik said.</p>\n<p>Rogue mosques came under the spotlight in Indonesia, where the counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 was established. During a second Bali bombing in 2005 Malaysian bomb-maker Azahari Husin was killed by US-trained anti-terror police, just as splinters began to emerge within JI&#8217;s ranks.</p>\n<p>Hard-liners were rebuked by the moderates who claimed too many Muslims were dying. As a result Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT) was formed by Abu Bakar Bashir and according to the International Crisis Group it quickly became an important player in the Indonesian jihad network.</p>\n<p>However, the regional crackdown was gaining in pace. Hambali was moved to Guantanamo Bay. Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Huda bin Abdul Haq were executed by firing squad in 2008 for carrying out the first Bali attacks.</p>\n<p>Malaysian bomber Noordin Mohammed Top exited JI and began his own strikes that included the July 2009 suicide bombings of luxury hotels in Jakarta. This was widely seen as revenge for the execution of Amrozi and his cohorts.</p>\n<p>Soon after, Top was shot dead by police on Java.</p>\n<p>In a bid to galvanise themselves, hard-line remnants of JI and an assortment of other outfits regrouped at a training camp in the mountains of Aceh early last year _ among them was JI&#8217;s senior leader Umar Patek _ where the next wave of attacks and assassinations were mapped out. But there was a leak.</p>\n<p>Another 100 alleged terrorists were captured or killed after that initial meeting including Dulmatin, another Bali bomber. Bashir was then jailed for 15 years and Patek was captured in Pakistan in January. He was living close to bin Laden in Abbottabad who was shot dead in early May.</p>\n<p>Security analyst Gavin Greenwood from the Hong Kong-based Allan &amp; Associates echoed Mr Malik&#8217;s sentiments, saying US military and intelligence priorities in the region had taken priority, however, this was at the expense of wider US national diplomatic interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The globalisation of local conflicts _ by this I mean the domestic insurgencies in the Philippines and Thailand though interestingly not Burma _ became absorbed into the US war on terror rather than remaining discrete and largely autonomous conflicts,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The US has often chosen to ignore or brush aside its previous standards on countries&#8217; human rights records. Indonesia is the best case in point,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Ten years after 9/11, America&#8217;s standing in Southeast Asia remains a thorny issue which Mr Greenwood said had been compromised among the wider population for its support of repressive regimes whose principal concerns are the maintenance of their own privileges, status and wealth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This association historically fuels anti-American sentiments among a broad section of society that otherwise may be expected to have seen the US as a source of support rather than a prop for unpopular or inept regimes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of more concern to Mr Abdullah is rooting out remaining jihadists and the rehabilitation of past offenders.</p>\n<p>Despite success, no one believes the era of bloody Islamic militant campaigns is over. Cells have become smaller, harder to detect and focused on local targets.</p>\n<p>Indonesian police stations have come under attack as a result.</p>\n<p>Fanaticism and militancy, driven by ideology remain with radicalisation of prison inmates a continuing sore point. The Abu Sayyaf are far from spent and strife in Thailand&#8217;s South continues unabated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tackling religious radicalism not only requires tremendous regional concerted efforts but most importantly the right strategies and programs for rehabilitation process,&#8221; Mr Abdullah said.</p>\n<p>Malaysia has been at the forefront of rehabilitation and occasionally fallen foul of its neighbours who view such a process as soft. But Mr Abdullah said radical behaviour, militant perceptions and attitudes had to be changed with former militants embracing mainstream values.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since 2005, 75 former militants associated with regional terrorist groups such as JI and even al-Qaeda underwent psychological healing processes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The government claims that none of those former detainees &#8230; returned to terrorist activities.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Malaysia may have found a way forward, but rehabilitation of offenders is unlikely to get a wider hearing given the success of Indonesia&#8217;s much harsher approach and lingering anger over the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent civilians that followed 9/11.</p>\n<p>The impact of the Sept 11 attacks on New York and Washington are still being felt across Southeast Asia a decade later. The bloody insurgencies that came in the aftermath still resonate and final closure still has some way to go.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; When hijackers crashed into the World Trade Center, their primary hope was to inspire a global jihad.

They were lucky to get 85g of rice a day, were beaten along the way and most who survived the 264km journey were shot or bayoneted.</p>\n<p>The atrocities were considered too great for public consumption and were hushed up by governments in London and Canberra for decades after the war. The truth remained largely hidden until five of the surviving six Australians began to speak openly about what happened in 1985.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was emotional, reflective and at times we were close to tears as you realise what happened here 66 years ago,&#8221; said Captain Dave Appleby.</p>\n<p>In more recent years the trek has been transformed into a pilgrimage for veterans of all wars and people wanting to pay their respects to the fallen along the Sandakan to Ranau route. In doing so, many have attempted to complete the historic trail but the journey has proven too arduous and no one has completed the full trek.</p>\n<p>As the chief guide, Tham Yau Kong, of the British expedition explained, there was always a reluctance to take hikers, particularly the unfit, into the uncharted jungle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Never had any of the numerous Death March groups done it, we kept it sacred only for a group where everyone is very very fit and this well trained British group is very, very fit,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The team, led by Major Claire Curry and Captain Chas May, hiked up to eight hours a day for almost two weeks, departing on VJ day (Aug 15), and reached the summit of Taviu Hill, which was the toughest part of the hike.</p>\n<p>The 70-degree slope was waterlogged and slippery from torrential rain and each member of the team had to form a chain and drag each other up and over the summit. This was followed by a three-hour hike through waist-deep water full with leeches.</p>\n<p>The odd snake was avoided; however, the razor sharp undergrowth was a constant problem. Each night the bagpipes were sounded and each morning a bugler sounded The Last Post and Reveille.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was an honour and a privilege to be the first from the British Military to walk the route and honour the fallen,&#8221; Maj Curry said. &#8220;The cohesiveness of the marching contingent was outstanding. It was exhausting and the group had to dig deep.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The expedition was put together by Major John Tulloch, a retired veteran of many conflicts including Vietnam, where he served with the New Zealand army, and Northern Ireland, after he transferred to the British military, where he served with the Royal Artillery Regiment.</p>\n<p>Maj Tulloch came to North Borneo, now the East Malaysian state of Sabah, in 1999 to commemorate the fallen. After some basic research he realised the vast majority of British soldiers who perished here were from his own Royal Artillery Regiment and this made it all the more personal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suppose the poignant moment was in 2004 when I had done my research into the various books that were out there, counted up and realised that 400 out of the 641 British POWs were from my regiment.

AsiaWATCH reports from southern India.</em></strong></p>\n<p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; Throughout the civilised world, the issuing of a death sentence is usually greeted by some controversy and India, a country known for its peaceful yet chaotic democracy, is no different.</p>\n<p>In August, India’s President Pratibha Patil formally rejected clemency pleas made by three men sentenced to death for their involvement in the 1991 assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.</p>\n<p>The decision came after a lengthy ten years of contemplation and was met by huge protests, particularly in the normally laid-back southern state of Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p>Whilst these protests highlight the underlining tensions that have long existed between southern India and the remainder of the sub-continent, they also bring to the fore the possibility that a significant miscarriage of justice could be committed.</p>\n<p>Have no doubt – Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination was a horrendous crime committed by those aligned to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</p>\n<p>Mr Gandhi and 14 others were brutally murdered at a political rally held on the outskirts of Chennai on May 21, 1991. A female suicide bomber detonated the explosive as she kneeled down to kiss Mr Gandhi’s feet in a traditional Indian display of respect.</p>\n<p>Yet advocates for death row convicts Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan make a persuasive case that hanging the men would be grossly unfair and out of proportion with their crimes.</p>\n<p>A year after Mr Gandhi’s death, a special investigations team charged 41 people with offences relating to the assassination, with 26 people eventually sentenced to death following secret trials conducted under the far-reaching terrorist act.</p>\n<p>After appeals to the Supreme Court, most of the guilty had their sentences reduced. Only the three death row convicts and one woman named Nalini had their death sentences upheld.</p>\n<p>This despite all three men having very little involvement in the assassination. Confusion reigns over each convicts’ exact level of involvement because their secret trials restricted public disclosure.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt they were, at the very least, LTTE supporters. But in Tamil Nadu, it is not uncommon even today for Tamilians to have some sympathy for the terrorist organisation, which fought for a separate Tamil state. It is known, however, that one man’s conviction was based on providing a battery that, allegedly unbeknownst to him, was later used in the explosive.</p>\n<p>Charging the men under India’s terrorism act allowed police and prosecutors greater flexibility than that offered in a normal investigation.</p>\n<p>Witnesses were not forced to disclose their identities, for example. The men – all aged under 21 – were charged as adults, an unusual legal decision in India.</p>\n<p>Police-obtained confessions were also declared admissible in Court, which also does not typically occur in corruption-plagued India.</p>\n<p>In later appeals, it was ruled that the assassination was not an act of terrorism and the trials should have therefore been made public. The confessions, however, were ruled admissible as evidence and the convictions upheld.</p>\n<p>These issues have of course already faced judicial scrutiny, making it futile for lawyers to cover these points once again.</p>\n<p>Instead, they will argue that having to wait 11 years for the President to make a judgment on the Tamil Tigers’ clemency pleas amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p>In addition, they say it would be unfair to hang the men when Nalini, the woman also sentenced to death, had her sentence commuted in part due to her gender.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court appears willing to consider these arguments and has granted an eight-week stay of execution.</p>\n<p>Whatever the outcome of its much-anticipated decision, the Supreme Court will set a considerable precedent.</p>\n<p>Presidential or gubernatorial decisions on mercy pleas are typically final and, whilst there is no mechanism to question the legality of their decisions, the Supreme Court will be dictating whether there should be a timeline on such petitions.  Hence its final decision will likely cause debates on constitutional, political and regional lines.</p>\n<p>A dangerous precedent would be set if decisions to commute death sentences were made on regional basis, yet in a post-LTTE world this is exactly what an overwhelming number of southern Indians are demanding.</p>\n<p>India’s Supreme Court should act to ensure that it is not making decisions based on regionalism, but that it is avoiding a devastating miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Are three men about to be unfairly executed?

With perhaps the biggest fleet in the Middle East the carrier is struggling with banks foreclosing on mortgaged vessels and insurers refusing to underwrite its operations.</p>\n<p>This has resulted in IRISL ships being arrested in Asian ports as banks clamor for their money back causing delays to customers and incurring additional financial penalties.</p>\n<p>Its ships – numbering about 170 – were once routinely sighted in Asian ports. Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and in the Malaccan Straits dividing Malaysia and Indonesia, IRISL vessels were among the biggest and newest to ply the waterways.</p>\n<p>Most of the goods shipped by IRISL were supplied by Chinese companies. For Iran’s nuclear program, China was key.</p>\n<p>David Albright, a US nuclear physicist who inspected Iran’s nuclear facilities for the UN’s atomic energy agency, said Iran was a regular purchaser of Chinese goods. This included high strength maraging steel, specialty vacuum pumps, Kevlar and carbon fiber.</p>\n<p>“Over and over, Iran goes there to buy things,” Albright, President of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, told the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.</p>\n<p>No-one doubts sanctions are causing significant delays to Iran’s nuclear enrichment plans.</p>\n<p>The US and its allies argue Iran’s nuclear program is a cover for weapons development and sanctions have been credited with hindering Iranian efforts to acquire carbon fibre and maraging steel used in centrifuges that can enrich uranium to make a nuclear bomb.</p>\n<p>“Iran has consistently used its national maritime carrier to advance its missile programs and to carry other military cargoes,” said Stuart Levey, US Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said after the fourth round of sanctions were imposed in June last year.</p>\n<p>Tehran denies the allegations saying its nuclear industry is for electricity generation and civilian use however it is yet to show any evidence of making fuel from enriched uranium.</p>\n<p>The sanctions recently came to a head in Singapore where a sheriff’s sale of three IRISL ships was organized. The vessels were seized but released by the courts – spoiling a bargain hunters’ day out &#8212; after IRISL stumped-up the funds to meet loan repayment demands.</p>\n<p>The commotion over IRISL has left the authorities in Iran in a flap, prompting the carrier’s chairman Mohammad Hossein Dajmar to go on the offensive through selective local and international media.</p>\n<p>He says the sanctions violate international law and he was scathing of Singapore and the banks after his three ships were impounded by the island-state.</p>\n<p>“We had a loan and (the banks) changed it from a loan to a due payment because of sanctions. In other words, they committed a violation. Because the loan contract was signed before the sanctions,” he said.</p>\n<p>He also told the <em>Financial Times</em> that sanctions had not hurt the company’s bottom line and that revenue for the eight months from March 2010 was up 40 percent while shipping transactions had grown 25 percent.</p>\n<p>However, that stretches plausibility, given another four European financial institutions are seeking the arrest of five recently built IRISL ships after alleged defaults worth $US268 million.</p>\n<p>Two of the vessels were detained, the Decretive in Hong Kong and the Dandle in Malta last November – at the request of the banks.

It has also been sanctioned by the US and EU as an IRISL lender.</p>\n<p>Even older Iranian allies from within the Organization of Islamic Conference are distancing themselves. Indonesia has told Iran not to proceed with its weapons program while Malaysia has signed off on its Strategic Trade Bill and signaled a change in stance, backing sanctions.</p>\n<p>The bill will enable the authorities to crackdown on companies and seize material bound for export that could be used in Weapons of Mass Destruction. Kuala Lumpur had previously been forced to repudiate allegations it was aiding Iran’s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>WikiLeaks cables named two Malaysian companies &#8212; Electronic Components and Skylife Worldwide – for possible breaches of sanctions, acting as front companies for Tehran.</p>\n<p>“As members of the UN Security Council southeast Asian states are obligated to comply with its resolutions. But capacity and political will are areas that often inhibit compliance. Singapore is generally the exception,” Emeritus Professor Carl Thayer, with the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra, told <em>Spectrum</em>.</p>\n<p>In the case of Iran there are different factors at play in each country, he said</p>\n<p>Thayer said Malaysia has begun to tilt more to the US in recent years. However, in Thailand, Universal Transportation Limited had proudly boasted its position as agent for IRISL with 14 vessels despite Thailand being designated a major non-Nato ally by the US.</p>\n<p>Britain acted unilaterally, freezing all business ties with IRISL under its terrorism laws, meaning the shipping line has been denied access to British underwriters and the first class insurance providers in London.</p>\n<p>This has forced the carrier to take up insurance from the relatively unknown Iranian provider Moallem. It remains unclear whether Moallem is re-insured by the Iranian state or whether it purchases re-insurance cover outside the usual European and US markets.</p>\n<p>This means that financing for IRISL’s ships which existed prior to sanctions, although legal in principle, is now a much more risky proposition for the banks concerned, to say nothing of potential reputational damage to a bank from dealing with a sanctioned entity.</p>\n<p>IRISL also stands accused of attempting to evade sanctions through a complex network of front companies to take advantage of loopholes in maritime law.</p>\n<p>The companies amount to a paper shuffle, sharing the same address, employing the same staff and renting the same office space as the initial IRISL operations.</p>\n<p>“The company started to use an array of deceptive practices to conceal its identity and skirt sanctions – including falsifying shipping documents, changing names and nominal ownership of vessels and even repainting ships,” Levey said.</p>\n<p>In 2009 IRISL established Hafiz Darya Shipping Company (HDSL) focusing on containers and Sapid Shipping Lines which specialized as a bulk carrier. A third company Hanseatic Trade and Trust was established to manage four new IRISL vessels.</p>\n<p>As a result, another 24 affiliated companies were blacklisted in January. Sixteen were traced to the same Hong Kong address and another four to the Isle of Man. IRISL owned vessels are often registered in a third country like Hong Kong, Germany or Malta.</p>\n<p>The doubtful quality of insurance now held by IRISL and failure to meet scheduled repayments on loans began prompting creditors to demand repayment in full.</p>\n<p>The three IRISL vessels – the Tuchai, Sabalan and Sahand – that were seized in Singaporean waters late last year were German registered and impounded after a High Court warrant was issued on behalf of French banks Credit Agricole and Societe Generale and The Export Import Bank of Korea.</p>\n<p>The banks were seeking $US210 million in alleged loan defaults and damages.</p>\n<p>Additional costs incurred by ship owners for an impounded ship can amount to about $US35,000 a day in docking and fuel charges. Further fines are imposed for delays and there are outstanding loans for the 80 new IRISL ships, according to Iranian press reports.</p>\n<p>“IRISL”s other older ships are also thought to be at high risk of seizure having also been re-mortgaged in exchange for new ones,” one Western maritime source said. “It is impossible that the company can pay back all the loans ahead of time.”</p>\n<p>As a result, IRISL is being forced to close some routes and the carrier’s days as a shipper of ballistic missile parts appear to be all but over &#8212; as is its future as a trusted name in trade – the latest casualty of sanctions on Iran.</p>\n<p>ENDS</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; In the second installment of a four part series Luke Hunt examines the regional response to Iran’s national shipping company and the issues created by sanctions against the Islamic country.

Parts of this article has appeared in previous publications. </strong></p>\n<p>International sanctions against Iran&#8217;s national shipping line in response to Tehran&#8217;s nuclear ambitions are mounting. The world&#8217;s largest container carrier Maersk has suspended operations at three Iranian ports while the US Treasury has launched legal action against 121 companies and individuals affiliated with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping (IRISL).</p>\n<p>The latest round of measures, for providing support to Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile and nuclear programs, came after IRISL was ostracized by the international maritime community with mortgage foreclosures on its ships and access to insurance greatly limited, prompting speculation IRISL is facing its own death knell.</p>\n<p>However, as IRISL limps on a new set of risks has emerged beyond sanctions with potentially catastrophic ramifications particularly in East Asia where the monitoring of IRISL&#8217;s fleet has improved dramatically but surveillance still remains patchy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Any Iranian ship in Asian waters should send alarm bells ringing as Iran tries by all means to escape sanctions imposed for its involvement in nuclear weapons proliferation,&#8221; said Carl Thayer, Emeritus Professor with the University of New South Wales.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The effect of the sanctions led IRISL to put unsafe ships to sea, where they pose a potential environmental hazard. Who will foot the bill if an IRISL ship is involved in an accident and spills its fuel? Asia states that allow IRISL ships into their ports should have second thoughts,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Doing business with Iran and IRISL has become increasingly difficult in recent years with United Nations, European and US sanctions making even the most aware operator cautious about trading with country.</p>\n<p>Tehran insists the sanctions are unjust and its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes while IRISL has echoed those sentiments and says its operations remain profitable and sound.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not want nuclear arms, nor are we seeking to possess them. These weapons are directed against people. We oppose them because of our religious beliefs &#8212; our religion says that they are prohibited. We are religious,&#8221; Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad said recently.</p>\n<p>While maintaining this stance IRISL has also been accused of attempting to evade sanctions through a complex network of front companies to take advantage of loopholes in maritime however but it is maritime law which now poses a problem for IRISL and the waters that its ships ply.</p>\n<p>Under the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (2001) ship owners are required to hold insurance or other financial security to cover the liability for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability, This limit is usually up to $US1.0 billion.</p>\n<p>A well documented cat and mouse game has been played out against IRISL and its efforts to buy adequate insurance for its operations. Of one specific class of insurance &#8212; Protection and Indemnity or P&amp;I &#8212; potential consequences could be felt beyond the US, Europe and Iran and especially in Asia.</p>\n<p>When goods are shipped around the world, the owners of the goods and vessels usually take out marine insurance. This cover, however, does not generally extend to third-party liability in the event of an accident.</p>\n<p>&#8220;P&amp;I cover is third party liability insurance which provides compensation to third party victims of maritime incidents,&#8221; said Andrew Bardot, Secretary-General of the International Group of P&amp;I Insurers.</p>\n<p>It is essential to reassure port authorities that should a vessel run aground, collide with another ship, are involved in an oil spill or fall foul of a serious incident, insurance cover is in place to pay for damage to ships, ports or the environment.</p>\n<p>The great costs associated with the Deep Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico of between $US2 billion and $US5 billion or the still evolving Fukushima disaster in Japan have driven home such nightmare scenarios. The Exxon Valdez showed litigation and reparations could take decades to resolve.</p>\n<p>IRISL&#8217;s P&amp;I cover was withdrawn by Lloyds of London in 2009 following UK sanctions against the shipping line. IRISL then found cover from a P&amp;I provider operating out of Bermuda. In 2010 Bermuda passed legislation, bringing them in line with the UK.</p>\n<p>&#8220;EU regulations have resulted in cover being terminated or not renewed for a number of designated Iranian shipping companies including IRISL and the NITC (National Iranian Tanker Company),&#8221; Bardot said.</p>\n<p>IRISL then approached the Islamic P&amp;I club who refused to provide cover.</p>\n<p>Finally IRISL secured P&amp;I cover from Moallem, an Iranian insurer with no record of providing this type of insurance. NITC was faced with a similar issue with regards to P&amp;I cover and has publicly stated it is using an &#8216;Asian P&amp;I provider&#8217; stating cover is reliable but more expensive than that secured through London. However, the lack of transparency on the identity of the provider does nothing to reassure on the reliability of the cover.</p>\n<p>On December 21, the US Treasury sanctioned Moallem.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; In the third installment of a four part series Luke Hunt examines the insurance issues to Iran’s national shipping company and the issues created by sanctions against the Islamic country.

Parts of this article has appeared in previous publications.  </strong></p>\n<p>All P&amp;I providers re-insure against catastrophic losses, which kicks in for large exposures, it is not clear who Moallem uses for re-insurance. Major European insurance houses would not be in a legal position to offer cover while the Peoples Insurance Company of China (PICC) has been touted as a possibility.</p>\n<p>But analysts said given its ongoing negotiations over access to Lloyds of London it was highly unlikely that PICC would risk its international standing by being associated with a controversial and sanctioned client like IRISL.</p>\n<p>As noted by Bardot: &#8220;Details of the cover are unknown.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Within maritime circles the presumption is the Iranian government is the reinsurer of Moallem.</p>\n<p>Analysts said given doubts about Moallem and the severe restrictions on the Iranian government, banks and other institutions, how IRISL and Tehran would react to a shipping and environmental calamity and what options were opened for redress and compensation goes to the heart of the issue.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an issue that Greenpeace says must be addressed by the 10-nation Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) given the threats to livelihoods and food security &#8212; and any legal loopholes should be closed while uninsured ships must be barred from entering regional ports.</p>\n<p>Keith Loveard, a regional security analyst with Jakarta-based Concord Consulting said an Iranian shipping disaster off the coast of Indonesia would cause rifts within government circles as was evident with the leak from a Thai rig off the northern Australian coast last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The government would be caught between different currents with the foreign ministry attempting to maintain smooth relations while the environment ministry would be hopping mad and local communities would be left to deal with the mess.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is all very hypothetical but the longer rogue ships operate without any insurance cover the likelihood of something going wrong obviously increases,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Others suggested a means of recovering costs incurred in dealing with an environmental incident would be to sequester any Iranian state-owned property or assets within the affected country such as aircraft operated by state-owned Iran Air.</p>\n<p>Gavin Greenwood, a risk analyst with Hong Kong-based Allan &amp; Associates said the recent seizure of a Thai aircraft used by the country&#8217;s crown prince in Germany to try and resolve a long standing dispute over money was one example over how this could work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The International Court of Justice could also be involved, though this is a long term proposition,&#8221; he said, adding &#8220;Iran used the ICJ to claim restitution from the US after a US Navy warship shot down an Iran Air Airbus in July 1988.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mohan Malik, Professor of Asian Security at the Asian-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu said the location of an accident involving the Iranian shipping line would also be important.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If it happens in the busy Malacca Straits or in the South China Sea, most littoral and major powers will be forced to contribute to the clean up in order to facilitate an uninterrupted flow of energy and goods,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course there will be law suits against the Iranian government too but the Islamic clerics can be expected to invoke Allah&#8217;s wrath on those who do so. Also the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other UN agencies would be called upon to play a greater role in ensuring that uninsured shipping lines are not allowed to operate in international waters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The IMO declined to comment on IRISL, however, sources close to the organisation said it was undertaking amendments to its strategic direction in regards to liability and compensation claims in the wake of the Deep Horizon disaster.</p>\n<p>Most maritime authorities demand a Blue Card from the P&amp;I insurer as evidence that sufficient insurance is in place to meet liability requirements under the Bunker convention.</p>\n<p>But in Asia it is not clear how routinely this is enforced or checked. If a maritime agency had doubts about the owners or operators ability to meet a liability it is able to deny a vessel entry or exit from ports or waters under its control.</p>\n<p>Thayer said that lack of clarity in Asia demonstrated &#8220;yet again&#8221; the weakness of the region&#8217;s security architecture and the reluctance of many Asian states to support sanctions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By allowing the IRISL to continue in the face of sanctions they are undermining not only good order at sea but inviting a disaster for which they will have to assume responsibility,&#8221; said Thayer. &#8220;Banning IRISL ships from Asian ports would be a good first step in supporting the non-proliferation regime and protecting the marine environment against an accidental fuel spill.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the US, EU and UK have taken the lead against Iran in regards to its declared and undeclared nuclear weapons ambitions, the real world impact of those sanctions are now being seen well beyond the Iranian interests that have been targeted.</p>\n<p>IRISL continues to operate in Asian waters, with untested and unproven insurance and the responsibility that Asia does not become a victim of events in Iran now fall onto the shoulders of Asian governments and their maritime authorities.</p>\n<p>ENDS</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; In the final installment of this four part series Luke Hunt examines the potential costs associated with Iran’s national shipping company, stemming from sanctions imposed against the Islamic country due to its controversial <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/part-four-picking-up-the-costs/\" title=\"PART IV: The Costs\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2011-10-23 15:48:57',8,2,12,'2011-10-23 15:48:57','2011-11-13 17:01:05'),(1494,1494,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/caning.jpg','Sharia Rising in Borneo','sharia-rising-in-borneo','<p><a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/caning.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1495\" title=\"caning\" src=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/caning-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The swish of a cane followed by the sharp “thwack” as it met a human back heralded a new era in Sabah last week.

Cambodia, they say, is too corrupt, too inept, or just to disinterested to find culpability for one of the great travesties of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Luke Hunt reports.</p>\n<p>The critics remain out in force but despite their often hysterical cries about the flaws of a troubled country the main event is about to resume next Monday at the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC).</p>\n<p>Former Brother Number Two Nuon Chea, one-time head of state Khieu Samphan, the former foreign minister Ieng Sary and his wife Ieng Thirith have indicated they will plead not guilty and fight tooth and nail charges of genocide and crimes against humanity once Case 002 begins on Monday.</p>\n<p>These four are most important because they are the surviving members of Khmer Rouge committees that wrote and deployed government policies which stripped Cambodia of its cultural heritage and a third of its population.</p>\n<p>Money was abandoned and cities emptied as millions were marched into the country side to work as slave labor. Hundreds of thousands were condemned to death because they did not fit Pol Pot’s vision of a pure Angkorian society.</p>\n<p>Muslim Chams, ethnic Vietnamese and intellectuals like high school teachers were among the high profile victims while people with dark skin – reflecting time under the sun and a communist approved peasant background &#8212; were applauded.</p>\n<p>Few could be more pleased to see Case 002 finally get underway than Mek Naing who struggles to raise his children on tiny farm on a dusty, remote road about 80 kilometers northeast of Phnom Penh.</p>\n<p>The 37-year-old divides his spare time between making charcoal and making sure intrepid travelers who find their way to Omlaing understand what happened here more than three decades ago and why the local villagers once gave up eating fish.</p>\n<p>Mek Naing is the unofficial keeper of M-13, the death camp established by Pol Pot and Kang Guek Eav, also known as Duch, in 1971.</p>\n<p>His dilapidated shacks are the nearest dwellings to the site, a three kilometer hike into the scrub, through thickets, secondary forest and two crossings of the Trapaing Chrab River.</p>\n<p>The mass graves left behind are impossible to find without the help of a local.</p>\n<p>At first glance the pits and ponds are visually much less dramatic than the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek on the outskirts of the capital or the evidence of violence and torture on display at Tuol Sleng, the infamous Phnom Penh high school which was transformed into the S-21 death camp.</p>\n<p>What made this clump of dirt significant was that M-13 served as the prototype for S-21 with Duch as commandant. Official estimates put the number of tortured and killed at S-21 near 16,000 but sources at the tribunal say fresh evidence indicates that number would now be closer to 24,000.</p>\n<p>About 200 such camps were constructed across the country once the Khmer Rouge seized power in April 1975 amid the Cold War power plays of the day.</p>\n<p>Much of the evidence surrounding M-13 emerged in Case 001 which last year resulted in a guilty verdict for Duch and the first successful prosecution for the ECCC. His 35-year jail term, before time off, is currently before an appeal.</p>\n<p>Among Duch&#8217;s revelations was the existence of the previously unknown M-13, established in the communist-held zone of Omlaing when Pol Pot&#8217;s forces were still battling the US-backed Lon Nol government for control of the country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important, in the telling of history, what happened 30 years ago,&#8221; said Khmer American author and lawyer, Theary Seng after Duch was convicted. &#8220;The Khmer Rouge tribunal is now shedding light on this very, very dark period.&#8221;</p>\n<p>About 300 people died in M-13.</p>\n<p>From behind a wall of bullet proof glass, Duch told the court that M-13 was designed to &#8220;detain, to torture, and to smash, that is to kill&#8221;. Chan Voeun, an M-13 employee, testified it was here that Duch was happy like a madman while torturing prisoners. This included hanging a woman from a tree, her shirt was stripped-off and her breasts burned with a lit kerosene rag.</p>\n<p>At S-21, a special unit of female guards looked after women prisoners. Babies were taken from their mothers, water boarding and electric shocks were common. Prisoners were kept alive long enough to have their blood drawn for use in field hospitals.</p>\n<p>Others were chained to a bed and decapitated. At Choeung Ek prisoners dug their own shallow graves, were bludgeoned with an ox-cart axle, had their throats slit and bodies dumped.</p>\n<p>A Vietnamese invasion ended Pol Pot’s reign in January 1979 and laid bare the atrocities committed over the previous three years and nine months. In Omlaing, Mek Naing says villagers threw a feast once the Khmer Rouge withdrew deeper into the countryside.</p>\n<p>It was then that the full scale of what happened at M-13 hit home.</p>\n<p>“What people noticed was an abundance of fish, which they cooked, and the smell of rotting corpses.</p>\n<p>“Men and women were handcuffed or tied to poles erected in large pits that filled up rapidly as the rainy season set in. They were drowned and fed to the fish. Their remains were left in the mass graves for decades, their bones still shackled to the poles.</p>\n<p>“People then realised what they were dining on, swore off fish more than a decade,” he said.</p>\n<p>Two decades of conflict followed the Vietnamese invasion. Another decade of peacetime bickering with the United Nations ensued before the ECCC could be established.</p>\n<p>Amid this the Khmer Rouge remained a cold war relic, escaping justice and denying their compatriots a chance to find closure on one of the darkest chapters of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

Luke Hunt reports.</p>\n<p>In the dock were party ideologue Nuon Chea, 85, known as Brother Number Two; former head of state Khieu Samphan, 80; and ex-foreign minister Ieng Sary, 86.</p>\n<p>The three are the last survivors of the Khmer Rouge Standing Committee that wrote and deployed government policy between April, 1975, and January, 1979, and has been the target of tribunal investigators.</p>\n<p>In the packed public gallery of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), people wept and some walked out in anger as co-prosecutors Chea Leang and Andrew Cayley outlined their opening arguments from behind bulletproof glass.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One in four Cambodians perished under Democratic Kampuchea &#8230; a loss of life unknown to any nation since the slaughter of all adult men and the enslavement of the women and children of the island of Milos by the Athenian state 2,400 years ago,&#8221; Mr Cayley said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When judged in relative terms by the proportion of a national population who died or were murdered, the scope of the human catastrophe unleashed by these accused on this country has no parallel in the modern era.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many of the crimes were aired in Case 001, which resulted in the ECCC&#8217;s first conviction in July of last year, registered against Kaing Guek Eav, or Duch, commandant of the S21 torture and extermination centre, for crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>But along with details involving mass murders, last week&#8217;s opening arguments brought further tales of torture, grisly accounts of cannibalism, bizarre sexual practices associated with forced marriages and the carnage committed in Kampong Chhnang province where a massive airport was under construction for the Chinese military.</p>\n<p>One prisoner had his feet nailed to a board and was ordered to sing while he was beaten. Pincers were used to pull nails, noses and ear lobes. At Sre Ambel, labourers toiled in fields until their legs were eaten away by salt water. Children were swung by the feet and their heads smashed into a tamarind tree.</p>\n<p>At Trapeang Thmar dam site, menstruating women were denied water for washing and trailed by clouds of flies, prisoners were forced to defecate in helmets that doubled as food bowls. In a video clip another woman spoke of how &#8220;they boiled human excrement to make fertiliser and they forced me to taste it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Others had their gall bladders removed which were then taken to the kitchen. One man was stripped naked to the waist and held by two Khmer Rouge soldiers while a third used a knife to rip open his stomach. The man&#8217;s entrails were ripped out and his liver removed while he was still alive.</p>\n<p>Mr Cayley asked the court to ensure its judgement would be decisive, saying the former leaders had robbed the country of decades of prosperity and left gaping holes in every Cambodian family.</p>\n<p>The alleged crimes _ including, genocide, murder and torture _ stem from the deaths of 1.7 million to 2.2 million people, a quarter of Cambodia&#8217;s population, under Pol Pot&#8217;s rule. About 800,000 are thought to have died violently, the rest through malnutrition, disease and exhaustion.</p>\n<p>The nightmare began within hours of the Khmer Rouge seizing control of Phnom Penh and forcing the evacuation of the capital and all urban centres amid fears by a paranoid hierarchy that the cities had become nerve centres for enemies of the movement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are few enemies in rural areas, and many enemies in the cities,&#8221; Mr Cayley quoted Nuon Chea as saying. &#8220;The evacuation was done to move the people to the countryside and smash enemy agents.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once residents were sent to the rural areas, they were enslaved along with the rest of the population in vast agricultural cooperatives, a system devised in 1972.</p>\n<p>The court was told how the likes of Nuon Chea sought to strip Cambodians of their belongings after money and markets were abandoned, and to cripple their spirits.</p>\n<p>The latter led to bizarre made-up rituals involving forced marriages.</p>\n<p>Speaking outside the court, Helen Jarvis _ a senior adviser to the Cambodian government and a former spokeswoman for the ECCC _ noted the Khmer Rouge had &#8220;hoodwinked the world&#8221; over the last three decades with its puritanical propaganda regarding morality and sex.</p>\n<p>Instead, prosecutors told how mass marriages were enforced between strangers. One ceremony involved men and women being forced to line up facing each other, the lights were turned off and they were told to walk towards each other and hold out their hands.</p>\n<p>They were forced to marry whoever they touched. Women who denied their husbands conjugal rights were shot. Desired young girls and women were given as trophy brides to favoured cadre and troops who had been handicapped in battle. Muslims were forced to marry non-Muslims.</p>\n<p>Couples who fell in love illicitly were executed.</p>\n<p>There were reportedly hundreds of thousands of forced marriages. The court was told how the practice was dictated by Pol Pot and his lieutenants as a means of orchestrating total control by wiping out all vestiges of Khmer culture.</p>\n<p>Evidence to be presented at the trial was derived from 30 crime scenes that were culled out of 196 security centres, 19,000 mass graves and construction sites, including a massive airstrip funded by and built for the Chinese government, long-time supporters of the Khmer Rouge.</p>\n<p>As many as 30,000 people were marched to the site and ordered to work.</p>\n<p>Conditions were so bad that many opted for suicide, leaping under passing trucks, or killing themselves by hanging, poisoning or drowning. The court was told how every member of the Standing Committee had visited the site. Among them was Khieu Samphan, who urged labourers to work harder.</p>\n<p>Mr Cayley said paranoia would eventually overwhelm the leadership, leading to purges and the decimation of their own ranks with tens of thousands dispatched to the security centres, and this had contributed to the downfall of the revolution.</p>\n<p>This was highlighted in 86 publications printed by the cadres that mentioned the words enemy, enemies or traitor more than 4,700 times, twice every page on average.</p>\n<p>While the prosecution offered fresh insights into what happened in Cambodia all those years ago, the defence fell back on old arguments.</p>\n<p>Inside the tribunal, Khieu Samphan appeared upset at times and Ieng Sary showed signs of disbelief as they listened to allegations of how they had systematically turned Cambodia into a country of unpaid slaves through their unrealistic and irrational policies.</p>\n<p>In response, Nuon Chea who sat motionless, dismissed the opening argument as not true before launching into an unrepentant tirade of communist cliches, blaming US bombings and Vietnamese designs on Cambodia for policies that arose as they came to power.</p>\n<p>He said Vietnam intended to &#8220;swallow Cambodia and rip Cambodia of her ethnic race&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He said Cambodian problems were exacerbated by the 1970 coup which ousted Prince Norodom Sihanouk and installed US-friendly Lon Nol as leader, which resulted in millions of homeless people and enormous shortages of food and medicine while foreign infiltrators were sabotaging the country.</p>\n<p>Nuon Chea did not mention any of the victims who suffered under Khmer Rouge rule. He simply added in regard to the events that led to Pol Pot coming to power: &#8220;The Lon Nol clique could not control this situation at all&#8221;.</p>\n<p>That line was echoed by Khieu Samphan, who said the prosecution had invented fairy tales and argued they were relying too heavily on uncorroborated reports from journalists at that time, adding he never wielded any real power and had only ever spoken twice at Standing Committee meetings.</p>\n<p>Ieng Sary again argued a pardon granted by King Norodom Sihanouk in 1996 as part of a peace deal that ended the civil war two years later meant that he should not face charges due to double jeopardy.

These tyrants died in their beds without ever answering for, in Stalin&#8217;s case, the famines and the bloody 1937 Moscow trials, and in the Chinese chairman&#8217;s, for the Great Leap Forward, and resulting mass hunger that claimed 30 million lives.</p>\n<p><strong>James Pringle</strong> writes for <em>Asian Sentinel</em>.</p>\n<p>Now three elderly Cambodian men from 80 to 86 years old &#8211; those who made the Khmer Rouge policies &#8211; must answer, in a trial that opened in Phnom Penh this week, for at least 1.7 million deaths, and the destruction of one of Asia&#8217;s once most culturally splendid of countries, whose onetime king, Norodom Sihanouk, still fit at 90, used to call &#8216;an oasis of peace.&#8217;.</p>\n<p>The co-prosecutors&#8217; opening litany of horrors this week were revelatory, although most of the facts of Khmer Rouge rule are now known. But it was the putting together in one coherent story the horrific details of this chilling &#8216;Utopian nightmare,&#8217; what national co-prosecutor Mde Chea Leang, called &#8216;a system of brutality that defies belief,&#8217; that had such an impact.</p>\n<p>It was one of the most harrowing several hours of my life,&#8221; said one spectator in the public gallery, a foreign lawyer.</p>\n<p>From where I was sitting in court, which resembles nothing so much as a theatre with curtains that dramatically open to reveal the accused, prosecutors and judges in a single tableau, I watched Cambodian rural folk who had risen at 2 am that morning in their remote villages to be bussed here, dabbing their tears or, overcome with memories of murdered loved ones, hastening from the chambers.</p>\n<p>Rhetorical flourish was in full cry from both sides. An &#8216;ocean of blood&#8217; was how one of the co-prosecutors described that former &#8216;oasis of peace&#8217; after the Khmer Rouge trudged into Phnom Penh on Apr. 17, 1975. Khieu Samphan, 80, the onetime Democratic Kampuchea president, called the prosecution case &#8216;spinning of fairy-tales.&#8217;</p>\n<p>On a much smaller scale, though proportionately by population not so much so, the Cambodia&#8217;s nightmare was on a level with the horrendous death levels of the Soviet Union and Maoist China. At least the horrors in the Soviet Union were addressed by Nikita Khrushchev&#8217;s 1956 &#8216;secret&#8217; speech to the 20th Soviet party conference three years after Stalin&#8217;s death. China has yet to make such an accounting of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and Mao is still revered by many.</p>\n<p>This accounting is now being made in Cambodia in a process that is likely to last two years or more. Zone chiefs, and the leadership&#8217;s drivers and other factotums will be among those called to give evidence on what the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders really knew about the widespread and brutal killings.</p>\n<p>In fact, is it communism, now a defunct philosophy in Vietnam and China, even in Cuba, that is also on trial here in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). It&#8217;s certainly one of the most important international triibunals since the Nuremberg trials of 21 Nazi chiefs, though those occurred just a year or so after World War II ended, whereas the Khmer Rouge tribunal opens some 36 years after the horrific events that brought Cambodia for a time, back to the 14th century, at least in rural areas, as I saw myself in mid-1979,. In Phnom Penh, I saw Cambodians on hands and knees picking up grains of rice off the road.</p>\n<p>This time gap accounts for the baffled looks on the faces of the rows of young uniformed students in court whose schools and parents have shielded them from the horrors that spread from Vietnam after the American invasion of Cambodia, ordered by then US President Richard Nixon in April, 1970 (which this correspondent rather nervously covered from a rickety South Vietnamese helicopter on the second day of the invasion, making several landings in which seemed like contested territory).</p>\n<p>These students, and the villagers, listened as the British co-prosecutor, Andrew Cayley, said of the Khmer Rouge: &#8220;They took from the people everything that makes life worth living: family, faith, education, a place to rear one&#8217;s children, and a place to rest one&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The British barrister added later: &#8220;No one in this country is left unhurt or unaffected by what these three elderly men have done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were other literary moments &#8211; and also rhetorical overkill &#8211; with Nuon Chea, aged 85, and otherwise known as Brother Number Two (to the late Brother Number One Pol Pot,) compared Vietnam’s relationship to Cambodia to &#8216;a python suffocating a young deer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most eloquent member of the Khmer Rouge, Shakespearian expert Ieng Thirith, 79, wife of Ieng Sary and Democratic Kampuchea&#8217;s minister of social affairs, was excluded on from the court on the grounds of dementia, though her case will be looked at again, after she has been gradually weaned off tranquilizers and anti-psychotic drugs that have been used to calm her. In 2009 she had already invoked Dante by cursing her accusers to &#8216;the seventh level of hell.&#8217;</p>\n<p>For French defense lawyer (for Khieu Samphan) Jacques Verges the trial process was like something from &#8216;a novel by Alexandre Dumas,&#8217; but he also raised the dire issues of the dropping of Agent Orange on the Ho Chi Minh trail, and the carpet bombing of Cambodia by B.52s.</p>\n<p>While the court here is limited in its consideration of what happened only between 1975 and 1979, the period of Khmer Rouge control, already in three days it has expanded further. Perhaps there is a need, it is suggested, to look back to the 1950s, when Pol Pot and his cohorts were studying as students in Paris, close to the &#8211; at that time Stalinist &#8211; French Communist Party, to understand what made do what they did on what Mao might have called the &#8216;blank sheet of paper&#8217; that was Cambodia&#8217;s political awareness in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Cambodians are not naive any longer about politics but they have certainly had to learn about them the hard way, for they still live under the tough regime of a former Khmer Rouge who nevertheless broke with the Beijing-backed (at the time) Khmer Rouge.</p>\n<p>Other names in connection with the war, such as Dr Henry Kissinger and the secret bombing of Cambodia in 1969 have already been brought to the attention of the court, as has the &#8216;fascism&#8217; of the Lon Nol regime, which committed its own massacres of Vietnamese in 1970. It is difficult to see how these factors can be totally ignored.</p>\n<p>The sins of the Soviet Communist Party under Stalin were bravely raised by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 at the 20th congress, though hints of Stalinism still linger on as a certain nostalgia for the Soviet Union. Mao&#8217;s sins have never been expatiated; his portrait still hangs from Tiananmen Gate .</p>\n<p>Communism in Cambodia, through Khmer Rouge rule that lasted nearly four years, has been discredited forever and, not to be tendentious about it, all of us should be grateful that some accounting, at least, is now taking place. Nuon Chea managed to review Khmer Rouge rule without ever mentioning the brutal evacation of the whole population of Phnom Penh in Rpril, 1975. &#8220;All of these accusations are not true.&#8221; he said of the prosecution&#8217;s statements.</p>\n<p>Chhang Song, a former information minister, well known to all journalists who covered the war in Cambodia,, is right when he says that this is the biggest trial in the history of Cambodia and exaggerating only slightly when he calls it &#8216;one of the biggest trials in the history of the world.&#8217;</p>\n<p>One woman outside the courtroom summed up what all Cambodians feel and express: &#8220;The people of Cambodia really want, after 36 years, to hear what the Khmer Rouge leaders have to say, to explain what we went through.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Whether they will be satisfied with the answers remains to be seen.</p>\n<p><em>This article first appeared in Asian Sentinel.</em></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; The current trial of surviving Khmer Rouge leaders in Phnom Penh is the judicial process that Stalin and Mao never faced.

Italy was the next to face the wrath of the bond markets, with Hungary the latest. The question has become – when will it be France?</p>\n<p>In this, the Asian Century, world leaders are turning to the emerging economies of the Far East as a potential saviour for the unfolding debt crises.<br />\nGermany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicholas Sarkozy both pointed to China as being a potential banker for the much-derided Eurozone bailout fund. Alas, China can’t be everyone’s banker and the United States has long been their preferred customer.</p>\n<p>But world leaders are right to turn to Asia’s emerging economies. They need to do more to jumpstart the global economy, for their own good more than anyone else’s.</p>\n<p>Most Asian economies are in pretty good shape if you look at what is arguably the most important indicator of an economy’s long-term health – that being the savings or investment rate.</p>\n<p>These closely aligned economic variables represent the fraction of a country’s total income that is saved or invested.</p>\n<p>Much financial news in Asia focuses on the extreme rates of inflation, the corruption and the waxing and waning of the respective share markets.</p>\n<p>The phenomenal rise of the savings and investment rates often goes unnoticed.</p>\n<p>And the populations of most of Asia’s emerging economies are assiduous at squirrelling away their hard earned cash.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the Chinese banked 38 per cent of their income, whilst Indians put 34.7 per cent away for a rainy day. This savings culture has contributed to a global imbalance, however, between developed and emerging economies.</p>\n<p>These developing countries will need to spur domestic spending to buffer themselves from American or European shoppers who will be spending less on Chinese toys, Vietnamese clothes or Indonesian home wares. It is likely we will continue to see the buoyant saving (or paying down debt) and the stagnant investment that is pervasive in the current economic environment. This means governments will be reliant on previous dollar-pinching Chinese emerging classes to drive economic growth.</p>\n<p>Governments across Asia, and particularly China and India, will need to do more to stimulate consumption and investment and discourage savings. In effect, this is mostly the opposite of what Chinese leaders have done in the past. China’s extremely high household savings rate is a way of forcing the poor working class to subsidize the Chinese export sector.</p>\n<p>People also view saving as a purely precautionary measure. The social safety nets in many Asian countries are appalling or non-existent. Households need to save to send their child to a decent school or in case a relative becomes sick.</p>\n<p>Governments need to promote financial-sector development and improvements in social safety nets, both of which will reduce the need for pre-cautionary savings. Such measures of course cost money and it is unlikely that Asian leaders will want to spend money on healthcare in the midst of a race for militarisation.</p>\n<p>All this means that economic forecasters are probably right when they suggest global imbalances are unlikely to be eliminated any time soon.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; As the Eurozone debt crisis spirals from one embattled bond market to the next, it is becoming clear we are likely heading into a double dip global recession.

A few ended up on rooftops, some landed in an elementary school a few kilometres away, and one landed on a group of onlookers outside the Presidential Office.</em></p>\n<p>This prompted an eloquent response from Frankie Fook-lun Leung: &#8220;George Bernard Shaw said: Traveling only reinforces one’s prejudice. The more the Taiwanese interact with the Mainlanders, the more they realize they are not the same. Hence, not many Taiwanese, if the truth be known, really want Taiwan to be part of Mainland China. Even Deng Xiaoping’s One Country Two Systems is dropped from the lips of the Mainland propaganda machine. China has learned a hard lesson. If she takes up a position in favor of the KMT, it will have a boomerang effect: it helps the DPP. China and Taiwan and each of them have learned to play the game with more skill and delicacy. Just a carrot and a stick is not sufficient or effective for China. The dilemma Taiwan faces is this: if the Taiwanese economy has become so dependent on China’s, how can you convince your troops and other government agencies to maintain vigilance against a power which may one day conquer you.

Unpredictable, reclusive and bizarre, he was the most grotesque despot of our time.Starving North Koreans were forced to call the evil dictator “Dear Leader”, in what was one of the many cruel ironies of the planet’s most secretive nation.<br />\nKim Jong-Il enforced the most totalitarian system on earth. It is a crypto-religious cult where the legend of the Kim family is portrayed as immortal. North Koreans were told he descended from heaven onto a mountainside. By comparison, his reported death from a heart attack whilst travelling on a train seems almost normal.<br />\nHis legacy will range in scope from weird personal predilections to the state-induced famine of the 1990s that led to millions of unnecessary deaths.<br />\nTo be sure, Kim Jong-un will mark his leadership with some military action. This is designed to remind the world that he is now in charge of North Korea’s atomic arms arsenal. Not that it needs reminding.<br />\nSouth Korea and the rest of the world already look to the North with a heightened sense of alert, but in many ways it is utterly fruitless to urge North Korea to begin charting a new path.<br />\nAs it has for many years, China will continue to support North Korea. Yesterday’s announcement that Beijing had conveyed their sadness at learning of the passing of a “close friend” is another indication that they are satisfied with the status quo. From Beijing’s perspective, North Korea provides a convenient geographical buffer zone. A divided Korean peninsula removes the threat of a prosperous South Korea on its borders.<br />\nThat’s not to say that Beijing doesn’t find Pyongyang extremely difficult to deal with at times. But North Korea offers China strategic and proven leverage with the United States. A united Korean peninsula would also see greater numbers of Chinese fleeing across the border.<br />\nAt this point in time, a divided Korean peninsula also suits Washington and Seoul – so long at there is no significant uptick in tensions. The material costs of intervening in a post-dictatorial North Korea in a US presidential year would be disastrous for an already militarily stretched United States, whilst South Korea would be forced to spend billions in developing the North.<br />\nThat’s not to rule out any possibility; a new leader will likely be keen to prove himself.

Luke Hunt Reports.</p>\n<p>After two years of graphic and often offending evidence Malaysians will find out tomorrow whether opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, will spend up to 20 years behind bars when a verdict is handed down in his sodomy trial.</p>\n<p>Sodomy is illegal in Malaysia and Mr Anwar&#8217;s supporters maintain the charges that have made him a cause celebre are politically motivated and the verdict a foregone conclusion. The government of Prime Minister Najib Razak, however, insists the allegations are a matter for the courts alone.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the verdict will follow months of behind the scenes political posturing and manoeuvring designed to shore up Mr Najib&#8217;s political fortunes by his United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) ahead of a probable early election.</p>\n<p>Insiders say that election could be called shortly after Chinese New Year, as early as February, but the reality is Mr Najib can go to the polls any time he likes before the next scheduled poll falls due in mid-2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Najib can see the benefits in calling an early poll. He can win his own electoral mandate, shut down the critics in his own party and out,&#8221; one long-time UMNO observer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And his chances of leading UMNO to a much-improved performance over the debacle of 2008 will be enhanced if Anwar is not around,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Realising his electoral chances have been damaged by public indignation over the sexual nature of the charges, Mr Anwar has sought to counter by launching a nationwide tour last week culminating in a street rally and show of support expected tomorrow outside the High Court.</p>\n<p>Opposition figures say up to 100,000 people are expected but others, like Shamsul Iskandar _ the youth wing leader of Mr Anwar&#8217;s Parti Keadilan Rakyat (RKP) _ said he would be happy with a turnout of 20,000 amid fears of a confrontation with the authorities.</p>\n<p>Police have received at least 168 complaints by business groups as well as politicians who claim such a gathering would disrupt public order.</p>\n<p>Given the ugly violence which erupted last July when police and politicians, at the behest of Mr Najib, launched an ugly crackdown on peaceful protests calling for electoral reform, a feared showdown between opposition supporters and the authorities appears likely.</p>\n<p>Kuala Lumpur police chief Mohamad Salleh has sounded an ominous note: &#8220;If anyone proceeds to participate in this gathering, the police will take stern action, according to existing laws.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mr Anwar, who is married with six children, faced fresh sodomy charges in 2008 shortly after his PKR party delivered the government of then prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi an electoral drubbing when it lost its cherished two-thirds majority in parliament.</p>\n<p>The opposition currently has more than a third of the seats in parliament and controls four of Malaysia&#8217;s 13 states. It was UMNO&#8217;s worst performance in more than half a century of rule and Mr Badawi was ousted in a party coup to make way for Mr Najib.</p>\n<p>Graphic details of what allegedly occurred have been splashed across the front pages of government friendly newspapers ever since Mr Anwar&#8217;s 26-year-old former aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, began testifiying that Anwar forced him to have sex in an apartment.</p>\n<p>DNA samples from semen found on Mr Saiful&#8217;s body allegedly matched Mr Anwar&#8217;s, however, defence lawyers argued that Mr Saiful&#8217;s testimony was riddled with inconsistencies and that the DNA samples could have been unlawfully obtained and planted on Mr Saiful.</p>\n<p>There were also claims that forensic evidence was handled incorrectly.</p>\n<p>Mr Anwar has said the anti-sodomy laws enforced by authorities to put him on trial are archaic and could breed intolerance. He is bracing for the possibility of a long prison sentence.</p>\n<p>The charges have been widely condemned around the world by prominent figures, especially when considered in light of how Mr Anwar was dealt with over a previous jail term that stemmed from differences with former Prime Minister Mohammad Mahathir.</p>\n<p>Under Mr Mahathir, Mr Anwar was touted as a future leader until the pair fell out primarily over when and if he would assume the top post and differences over how to handle the 1997 Asian financial crisis.</p>\n<p>He was sacked as deputy prime minister and put on trial on charges of sodomising his family&#8217;s ex-driver and for abuse of power. He denied the charges, was severely bashed while in police custody, found guilty and jailed. Huge street demonstrations followed and Malaysia&#8217;s top court eventually overturned the sodomy conviction and he was released from prison in 2004, after six years behind bars.</p>\n<p>Figures as diverse as Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson have warned Malaysia that it has tarnished its business reputation by pursuing Mr Anwar and urged Mr Najib to intervene while governments around the world have supported his cause. In 2006, Mr Anwar said he had been asked to apply for the post of UN secretary-general.</p>\n<p>Mr Najib ignored all pleas to intervene and has launched his own charm offensive.</p>\n<p>He backed down from a previous tough stance and announced he would consider electoral reforms. He has also said he would repeal widely loathed laws that curtail civil liberties including the Internal Securities Act introduced by UMNO after Malaysia won independence from Britain in 1957.</p>\n<p>Mr Najib has also sought to open up the economy which discriminates in favour of native Malays over other ethnic groups in business and education and reign in Islamic hardliners who persistently antagonise the country&#8217;s Christians, Buddhist and Hindu populations.</p>\n<p>In October, Mr Najib handed down an election-friendly budget and importantly he has followed Mr Badawi&#8217;s lead and dramatically improved relations with the West.</p>\n<p>But if he fails to win back the two-thirds majority he could face a leadership challenge from his deputy Muhyiddin Yassin, a staunch supporter of Malay nationalism and an Islamic firebrand who courted controversy by ending the use of English as the medium for teaching science and mathematics.</p>\n<p>Still Mr Anwar insists his PKR three-party alliances can beat the UMNO-dominated Barisan Nasional coalition at the next election with an agenda based on curbing corruption and racial discrimination. He says contingency plans are in place in case he goes to jail.</p>\n<p>Assuming he is jailed, much of his responsibilities within the PKR will probably fall on the shoulders of his daughter, Nurul Izzah, who became de facto opposition leader when her father was previously jailed and unable to stand in 2008 because of his conviction for abuse of power.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The likelihood of our winning elections &#8230; is not a far-fetched idea,&#8221; Mr Anwar told the Associated Press recently. &#8220;We believe that change is imminent and for the benefit of all Malaysians.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Whether Mr Anwar can oust UMNO from power remains to be seen. If he continues in politics, it will probably have to be done from behind bars and success will depend largely on how he, his supporters, the police and UMNO politicians behave on Monday.</p>\n<p><em>This story first appeared in Spectrum, Sunday Bangkok Post. </em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; Speculation is rampant as to what impact the ruling in the sodomy case against the opposition leader will have on the fortunes of both his party and Prime Minister Najib Razak&#8217;s UMNO.

But the combination of indirect elections for the majority of senators and the appointment of a small minority makes the Cambodian Senate more like the upper house of parliament in India, widely described as the world&#8217;s biggest democracy. Interestingly, Myanmar has chosen a similar model for its new upper house of parliament, although the minority appointed (by the military) is proportionally much bigger.</p>\n<p>A total of 11,470 Cambodians were eligible to vote in the indirect election for the 57 seats up for grabs last Sunday, all of whom were elected under universal suffrage. Of those allowed to vote, 11,351 were commune councillors elected in 2007. The remaining 119 were members of the National Assembly elected during the last election for the lower house in 2008. The four other seats in the 61-member Senate are appointed by the King and the National Assembly.</p>\n<p>As voters were going to the polls last Sunday, an American news service with a long-standing presence in Phnom Penh told the world what was happening. Or at least what it thought was happening. Subsequently picked up  by countless newspapers and broadcast media,  the report asserted that the Senate elections in Cambodia were &#8220;closed to the general population and criticized for lacking credibility.&#8221; Largely closed was certainly true. But criticized by whom was not exactly clear, although the report did refer to unidentified &#8220;local monitoring groups&#8221; who reportedly &#8220;denounced the Senate elections, saying they do not reflect the will of the people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Such an assessment of the indirect election in Cambodia is not surprising. With their limited knowledge of the outside world, most Americans tend to view as deeply flawed anything that doesn&#8217;t resemble their own system of democracy, with a Congress comprising a House of Representatives and a Senate that are both directly elected.</p>\n<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then most of America&#8217;s partners in the Group of Seven (G7), the world&#8217;s most advanced industrialized nations, must have flawed democracies too since only Italy and Japan have direct elections for their upper houses of parliament (although Italy has an age requirement for voters in upper house elections that is higher than for voters in lower house elections). According to American thinking, the other G7 countries must be even worse.</p>\n<p>Take France. It has a system like Cambodia where senators are indirectly elected by an electoral college, in this case comprising about 150,000 elected officials. This represents about three-tenths of one percent of the country&#8217;s 44.4 million eligible voters. That compares with a bit more than one-tenth of one percent of the 9.2 million eligible voters in Cambodia. The &#8220;local monitoring groups&#8221; will no doubt argue that France is therefore three times more &#8220;democratic&#8221; than Cambodia. But the fact is that the electoral colleges in both countries at least indirectly reflect the wills of the French and Cambodian people. In both cases, we&#8217;re talking about less than one percent of registered voters.</p>\n<p>As for Germany, members of the upper house of parliament are simply appointed by the country&#8217;s state governments and can be recalled at any time. Britain and Canada are even less representative with members of the upper houses of parliament being appointed by the British queen, or her representative in the case of Canada. Appointments are  based on the recommendations of the prime ministers of the two countries. In other words, members of the upper houses of parliament in both Britain and Canada effectively represent the will of a couple of people.</p>\n<p>Among countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, six have bicameral systems of parliament with two chambers. Apart from Cambodia, these are Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand. The other four ASEAN members, Brunei, Singapore, Laos and Vietnam, have unicameral parliaments with only one chamber.</p>\n<p>Malaysia, a former British colony, has an upper house of parliament that is similar to those in Britain and Canada. Not all Senators are appointed by the Malaysian king, however, since a minority is elected by state legislative assemblies. Thailand has a hybrid system where a bit more than half the senators are elected and a bit less than half are appointed. So too does Myanmar where most of members of the upper house are elected with a sizable minority being appointed by the military. The only two ASEAN countries where all members of the upper house are elected directly by the people are Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere  in the Asia-Pacific region, upper houses in Australia and Japan are also directly elected, although the voting systems differ. On the other hand, most members of the upper house of the Indian parliament are indirectly elected, although a small minority are appointed by the country&#8217;s president, similar to the Cambodian system where the King and  National Assembly appoint two members each. In Russia, half of the upper house of parliament is indirectly elected and the other half appointed. As for New Zealand, its upper house, the Legislative Council, was abolished in 1951.</p>\n<p>With the exception of Myanmar, where information comes from the CIA, the following is taken from the websites of upper houses of parliament in the G7 nations, ASEAN and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region:</p>\n<p>AUSTRALIA (directly elected)</p>\n<p>In Australia, senators are elected under a system of proportional representation. The Senate has 76 members including 12 elected from each of the country&#8217;s six states. The other four are elected from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory which are each allocated two seats in the upper house. Senators served six-year terms with half the Senate retiring every three years.</p>\n<p>BRITAIN (appointed)</p>\n<p>In Britain, most of the 830 members of the upper house, known as the House of Lords, are life peers appointed by the Queen on the recommendations of the Prime Minister. Others are 26 archbishops and bishops from the Church of England and hereditary peers elected internally.  Church members pass on their membership to the next most senior bishop when they retire. Life peers used to be able to pass on their House of Lords membership to their children.  Although the rights of such hereditary peers to sit and vote in the upper house ended in 1999, internal elections have allowed 92 to remain. Since 2000, an independent public body known as the House of Lords Appointment Commission makes recommendations for appointing non-party-political life peers and vets nominations for life peers.</p>\n<p>CANADA (appointed)</p>\n<p>In Canada, senators are appointed by the Governor General, the representative of the Queen of England who also serves as the Queen of Canada. The appointments are based on recommendations by the Prime Minister. The Senate usually has 105 members representing different provinces or territories (24 from the maritime provinces in the east, 24 from Quebec, 24 from Ontario, 24 from the western provinces, six from Newfoundland and Labrador and one each from Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut). Senators have to be at least 30 years old and own property and live in the province or territory that they represent. They hold office until the age of 75.</p>\n<p>FRANCE (indirectly elected)</p>\n<p>In France, senators are indirectly elected by an electoral college of about 150,000 people. The eligible voters are members of the National Assembly as well as regional, general and municipal councillors who are elected under universal suffrage. As of 2011, the Senate had 348 members (326 from metropolitan and overseas departments, 12 representing French people abroad, 2 from French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Mayotte and 1 each from Wallis and Futuna, Saint-Barthelemy, Saint-Martin and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon). Senators, who must be at least 24 years old, hold office for six years with half the seats coming up for re-election every three years.</p>\n<p>GERMANY (appointed)</p>\n<p>In Germany, members of the upper house, known as the Bundesrat, are appointed by the country&#8217;s 16 state governments. The Bundesrat has 69 members with between three and six members appointed by each state. In the federal states, only the Minister-Presidents and ministers can be members. In the city states of Berlin, Bremen and Hamburg, membership of the Bundesrat is limited to mayors and senators. Secretaries of state can be Bundesrat members if they have a seat and say in the cabinet of their federal state. Membership is decided by state governments and ends automatically if a member leaves the state government or if the state government recalls the member. All Bundesrat members have a twofold role in that they hold office in their federal state while simultaneously holding a federal office.</p>\n<p>INDIA (majority indirectly elected, minority appointed)</p>\n<p>In India, the upper house of parliament is known as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha). Its maximum strength is 250 members of which 238 are elected by the Legislative Assembly in each state and two of the country&#8217;s union territories with 12 appointed by the President of India. The actual strength of the council is currently 245 members of whom 229 are elected from the states, 4 from the two union territories (2 each from Delhi and Puducherry) with the remaining 12 appointed by the President. Members of the council serve six-year terms with a third of the members rotating every two years.</p>\n<p>INDONESIA  (directly elected)</p>\n<p>In Indonesia, the upper house of the People&#8217;s Representative Assembly is known as the House of Regional Representatives. The 132-member assembly was created by constitutional changes in 2001 that sought to develop a bicameral parliamentary system to replace the unicameral system. Since 2004, four senators have been elected from each of the country&#8217;s 33 provinces for five-year terms.</p>\n<p>ITALY (majority directly elected, minority appointed)</p>\n<p>In Italy, the Senate has 315 elected senators who must be at least 40 years of age. Only voters over the age of 25 can take part in Senate elections, unlike the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, where eligible voters are over 18. Elections are held every five years. In addition to the elected members, the Senate also has life senators who include former Presidents of the Republic and people appointed by the President for outstanding merit in the social, scientific, artistic or literary fields. There are currently six life senators,</p>\n<p>JAPAN (directly elected)</p>\n<p>In Japan, the upper house of parliament is known as the House of Councillors. It has 242 members of whom 146 are elected from the eligible voters in the country&#8217;s 47 prefectures. The other 96 members are elected under a  proportional representation system. Members of the House of Councillors serve for six years with half of the upper house retiring every three years.</p>\n<p>MALAYSIA (majority appointed, minority indirectly elected)</p>\n<p>In Malaysia, senators are either appointed by the king, the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong, or indirectly elected by state parliaments. Known in Malay as the Dewan Negara (House of the Nation), the Senate has 70 members. In each of the 13 states, the State Legislative Assembly elects two senators. The other 44 senators are appointed by the king on the advice of the Prime Minister including two members from the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and one member each from the Federal Territory of Labuan and the Federal Territory of Putra Jaya. Senators must be at least 30 years old, be of &#8220;sound mind&#8221; and not be an undischarged bankrupt or have a criminal record. Senators serve for three-year terms for a maximum of two terms.<br />\nMYANMAR (majority directly elected, minority appointed)<br />\nIn Myanmar, the new upper house is known as the Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities) and has 224 members including 168 elected directly for the first time in late 2010. The remaining 56 are appointed by the military. Members of the Amyotha Hluttaw serve five-year terms.</p>\n<p>THE PHILIPPINES (directly elected)</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, all senators are elected under a &#8220;plurarity-at-large&#8221; voting system of non-proportional representation. The Senate, which has 24 members, is a reincarnation of the upper house of Congress formed by a 1940 amendment to the 1935 Constitution. The Senate was abolished in 1972 and returned only after a new constitution was adopted in 1987. Senators serve a term of six years and cannot serve beyond two consecutive terms.</p>\n<p>RUSSIA (half indirectly elected, half appointed)</p>\n<p>In Russia, the upper house of parliament, known as the Council of the Federation, consists of 166 members. Two members represent each &#8220;federal subject&#8221;, one elected from the legislative branch and the other appointed by the executive branch. The 83 federal subjects of the Russian Federation comprise 21 republics, 46 provinces, 9 territories, 4 autonomous districts, 2 federal cities and 1 autonomous province. Like Bundesrat members in Germany, members of the upper house in Russia effectively hold two positions.</p>\n<p>THAILAND (majority directly elected, minority appointed)</p>\n<p>In Thailand, senators are either elected or appointed by a seven-member Senators Selection Commission. Under the 2007 constitution, the Senate has 150 members. Since 2008, one is elected from each of the country&#8217;s 76 provinces. The other 74 appointed Senators are from academic institutions, the private sector, the public sector, professional organizations and other sectors including the military. The Selection Commission comprises the President of the Constitutional Court, the Chairman of the Election Commission, the President of the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, the Chairman of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, the Chairman of the State Audit Commission, a  judge of the Supreme Court of Justice and a judge of the Supreme Administrative Court. Terms are for six years and Senators must be at least 40 years old.</p>\n<p>UNITED STATES (directly elected)</p>\n<p>In the United States, senators are directly elected and serve for six years. Each of the country&#8217;s 50 states has two senators regardless of population. Elections are staggered so that a third of the 100 senators rotate every two years.</p>\n<p><em> Photo by Luke Hunt</em></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; As Cambodians prepare to digest the release of the final results in last weekend&#8217;s Senate elections, they should at least feel comfortable with the knowledge that the body that convened its first meeting <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/cambodian-senate-elections/\" title=\"Cambodian Senate Elections\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-02-05 06:12:09',8,2,12,'2012-02-05 06:12:09','2012-02-05 06:17:04'),(1978,1978,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Burma1-400x2641.jpg','US Eases Burma Sanctions','us-eases-burma-sanctions','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The United States has begun easing sanctions on Burma, allowing it improved access to institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in response to a raft of reforms announced by the country’s President Thein Sein and his military-backed government.</p>\n<p>Effectively, the U.S. State Department will lift opposition to assessments of Burma, saying this was in response to the release of political prisoners and democratic reforms including allowing the opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to run in upcoming elections.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://the-diplomat.com/asean-beat/2012/02/08/u-s-eases-burma-sanctions/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more in <em>The Diplomat</em>.</a></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The United States has begun easing sanctions on Burma, allowing it improved access to institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in response to a raft of reforms announced by the <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/us-eases-burma-sanctions/\" title=\"US Eases Burma Sanctions\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-02-08 06:38:50',8,2,10,'2012-02-08 06:38:50','2012-02-08 06:38:50'),(1983,1983,'https://d18sfhl837dknt.cloudfront.net/featured/J1aR7bQQON3gwr3GipXyXJ1gmA3FSwKiRfjCj8hr.jpg','Philippines Kill Most Wanted','philippines-kill-most-wanted','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The Philippines military has killed three of the region’s most wanted terrorists, including Malaysian Zulkifli Khir, also known as Marwan, who was among the last leaders of the regional Jemaah Islamiyah terror network.

Noordin Mohammad Top won the inaugural Valentine’s Day prize posthumously in 2010 after he was gunned down by Indonesian authorities following an international man hunt and a very merry dance.</p>\n<p>In 2011, the prize was afforded to <em>Abu Bakar Bashir</em> who as spiritual head of JI has managed to avoid the death penalty in Indonesia but now remains happily behind bars.</p>\n<p>Ya’erbuti said while receiving Valentine’s Day wishes from his legions of fans. “Most of the region’s terrorists are in jail, dead or are sunning themselves on the beaches of Mindanao. The fact that Amin is still among us deserves a merit badge.”</p>\n<p>As always Ya’erbuti looked elegant in white and was flanked by his support crew, including the ever-loyal man-servant Waqil (EDS: ONE NAME) who sat proudly atop his camel, Spit. Ya’erbuti added that Amin could become the face of terrorism into the next decade.</p>\n<p>Analysts, however, said they were surprised by the choice, and that Omar Patek was probably a better choice given he is currently before the Indonesian courts after his vacation stint in Pakistan with bin Laden, who was killed in May.</p>\n<p>Ya’erbuti said he was aware of the dissention and added: “Simply because bin Laden bore an uncanny resemblance to the Grim Reaper and was posing for holiday snaps with Patek should not mean automatic brownie points for Patek.</p>\n<p>“The difference is Amin is free to pursue his chosen career as a regional terrorist and we’d like to take this award forward as opposed to too often focusing on has beens. Death or jailing simply means you are out of the game and no longer worthy,” Ya’erbuti said. “And how good is this man Amin?

The exorbitant costs often associated with delivering justice are at times kicked around with as much force as a political football before an election.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In Cambodia, this has remained a sore point since 1998 when Prime Minister Hun Sen served the United Nations with his wish list, following a coup and a series of skirmishes that finally ended three decades of war and left him at the helm of an impoverished, war ravaged nation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Prime Minister needed money and, despite his misgivings, a UN endorsed tribunal mandated with finding justice for up to 2.2 million people who perished under the Khmer Rouge and the traumatized survivors who watched helplessly as the ultra-Maoists annihilated his country’s culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Such a tribunal had been touted since 1979 when a Vietnamese invasion ended Pol Pot’s bloody rein of three years and eight months but remained unrealised amid Cold War politics and the ongoing civil war.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Amid the arguments were the dirtiest of questions: How much? And who should pay?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">A figure of $56 million was costed for the first three years of the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC), but this would eventually triple and the often screaming critics have found some traction for their arguments that the tribunal was flawed and the money wasted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to monetize the value of justice for victims of mass crimes, but all recent examples have shown that prosecution of international crimes such as genocide and crimes against humanity requires substantial resources,” said ECCC spokesman Lars Olsen.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The ECCC has spent about $150 million dollars since its investigations began in 2006.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The biggest funders are the Japanese with $70.57 million to date and cynics argue Tokyo enjoys funding the tribunal if only to embarrass their traditional enemy China, which backed, traded and sent foreign aid to the Khmer Rouge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Australia is ranked second with $14.2 million. Germany, the United States, France, the United Kingdom and a UN Trust Fund follow. Cambodia has spent about $5.16 million or 4.0 percent of the overall total.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Thirty countries and groups have contributed including Microsoft with a donation of $100,000, substantially more than the $25,000 from Thailand, which along with Western powers lent support to the Khmer Rouge who continued to battle occupying Vietnam troops until 1989.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Namibia and Armenia also gave small amounts, which Helen Jarvis, a senior advisor to the Cambodian government, said was telling given their own experiences with war and genocide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a great amount of money,” she said. Jarvis has been a diehard supporter of the ECCC since its inception and is a former head of the court’s victims unit. “It’s about the cost of one bridge. Is one bridge worth more than justice for so many people? I don’t think so.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Others like Brad Adams of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, however, are unimpressed claiming political interference has tainted the ECCC and the tribunal was delivering too little too late.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">“After five years and more than $150 million, the court has tried just one defendant, Kaing Guek Eav, alias Duch, the warden of the infamous Tuol Sleng detention center where approximately 14,000 people were tortured and then executed,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">In Case 001, Duch was sentenced to 35 years behind bars and has appealed. A decision is expected on February 3. Currently before the ECCC bench in Case 002 is party ideologue Nuon Chea, 85, former head of state Khieu Samphan, aged 80; and ex-foreign minister Ieng Sary, 86.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Allegations included crimes against humanity, murder, genocide, and torture. The three are the remaining survivors of the Khmer Rouge Standing Committee that wrote and deployed government policy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Members of that committee have always been the main targets of tribunal investigators. The court has heard grisly evidence of mass graves, cannibalism, rape, forced labor and bizarre forms of torture that ranged from electrocution to being fed to the fish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Olsen added that the ECCC was not costing more than other tribunals, in fact the Khmer Rouge Tribunal is relatively cheap. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has spent more than $2.0 billion since 1993 securing 63 convictions with another 35 on trial. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has spent $1.4 billion since 1994 winning 44 convictions with another 22 cases being heard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The Special Court for Sierra Leone has jailed eight people at cost of $200 million since 2002 and there is also the International Criminal Court (ICC) with an annual budget of $150 million but it can only hear cases concerning crimes that were committed since its inception in mid-2002.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Xavier Rauscher, a British based specialist in the laws of conflict, wrote in</span><em style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"> the International Jurist that the ICC had been subjected to a litany of complaints as it “offers even less value for money, having so far yielded only a dozen arrest warrants and indictments, all relating to Africa.”</em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Nevertheless he added the ICC’s supporters could justifiably argue the court’s existence had huge indirect benefits and sent a powerful message, “signaling to wrongdoers all over the world that their misdeeds risk retribution and that might does not always equal right.”</span></em></p>\n<p><em style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The ECCC has spent about </em><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">$30 million a year since investigations began five years ago, a third or more cheaper than the ICTR and ICTY. Costs are kept down by combining locals with international staff in a hybrid system of Cambodian and international laws.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a result the ECCC has been dubbed the most complicated war crimes tribunal since Nuremberg, established to try Nazis in the aftermath World War II but this has not stopped the UN from emulating this model in Sierra Leone and Lebanon.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">ECCC sources said foreign judges and lawyers were being paid between $120,000 and $150,000 a year which was could hardly be considered exorbitant when compared with a Western banker or a defence attorney in the US or a prosecutor in London.

Luke Hunt reports entry will be dictated by political connections, financial clout, further reforms and need.</p>\n<p>Chief among need will be food and infrastructure – roads, ports dams, electricity and access to clean water – but areas like health are also in dire need of investment. The World Health Organization ranks Myanmar 190<sup>th </sup>and the worst performer in the world in regards to health care.</p>\n<p>Access to capital and appropriate partners are the biggest issues.</p>\n<p>“Burma is one of the few frontier or ‘reservoir’ countries left &#8212; Cuba is another example &#8212; that have serious economic potential due to their resources and proximity to large developed or developing markets,” said Gavin Greenwood, a risk consultant with Hong Kong-based Allan &amp; Associates.</p>\n<p>China, Thailand and Singapore have been active in Myanmar for a decade while Japan, South Korea, India, the US and Europe have made recent forays and are easing sanctions. According to one analyst this was akin to “kicking the tires” to assess what’s possible and profitable.</p>\n<p>Two large ports are already under construction. China National Petroleum Corp has begun construction of a 770km oil pipeline from Myanmar’s west coast to China with port facilities being built in Madeira.</p>\n<p>That area offers access to nearby offshore oil and gas fields, existing port facilities which include a naval base, an existing airport at Kyaukphyu and a relatively deepwater and sheltered moorings for docking with an expected depth of up to 20 metres.</p>\n<p>Importantly the pipeline highlights Burma’s strategic importance, providing an alternative route for China’s energy needs to the Malaccan Straits.</p>\n<p>A massive $8.6 billion port and industrial complex is also under construction in Dawei in the south by Italian-Thai Development Co, which has a 60-year concession. The industrial park is massive, 16 times bigger than the largest of any such are projects already built in Thailand.</p>\n<p>“Looking ahead 20 years from now, 2030, the economy around the Indian Ocean would be growing more than it is now given the fact there are at least two major countries located nearby – China and India,” said Somchet Thinaphong, Managing Director of Dawei Development Co.</p>\n<p>“Burma and Dawei are in the middle. So this creates a uniqueness for new investments and we should immediately capitalize,” he said. “There is a route which represents a regional corridor, from Dawei passing through Bangkok to Vietnam. It’s a strategic corridor.”</p>\n<p>More importantly, he says, will be Myanmar’s strategic importance within the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which is aiming to become a fully integrated economic community by 2015, and the Dawei Special Economic Zone will become a hub of ASEAN.</p>\n<p>Essentially the 2015 goal is a stable, prosperous economy capable of competing with the likes of China and India with the free flow of goods, services, investments and capital &#8212; based on a single market and production base. It’s an incompatible ambition with Myanmar’s trajectory of recent decades and something had to give, given Naypyidaw’s ambitions of hosting the ASEAN chair in 2014.</p>\n<p>“The next big story is likely to be the new special economic zones, including along the borders with Thailand and China,” said Morten Pedersen, a Burma analyst with the University of New South Wales in Australia.  “This should include agri-business, which is certainly a big priority for the government.”</p>\n<p>He said from a developmental perspective with Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) increasing and broadening, a key issue in the coming years would be the quality of investment and this would also encompass human rights and environmental issues.</p>\n<p>“It will be a long time before the Burmese government is able &#8212; even if willing &#8212; to exert proper supervision in this area,” Pedersen added.</p>\n<p>Resource rich with a population of about 60 million, the potential size of Burma’s economy is comparable with Thailand and Vietnam but the immediate transitional period is expected to produce problems for an inward looking government and profit-demanding foreigners.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless the idea of a politically correct Burma will no doubt tantalize business with potential opportunities thought unimaginable just six months ago.</p>\n<p>“Burma is now entering its ‘age of reconnaissance’ as companies from countries that had shunned the country’s military regime for decades examine its potential  as a market for their products or services or source of  raw materials or low cost labour,” Greenwood added.</p>\n<p>The list of companies lining-up is a who’s who of the corporate world.</p>\n<p>Chief among Thai corporations are PTT, PTT Exploration &amp; Production, Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding and Hemaraj Land &amp; Development. These are likely to benefit from large infrastructure and border economic development projects.</p>\n<p>Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor have expressed an interest in locating a production base at Dawei as part of a broader strategy to reduce costs. Japan has also indicated it will help bank roll the project, although it would also like to restructure debt currently held by the country’s military leaders.</p>\n<p>Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo, all from Japan, along with Malaysia’s Petronas , American conglomerate General Electric Co, Danish shipping Line Maersk and Indian group Jubilant Energy are also planning to invest in the hope of growing their bottom lines.</p>\n<p>And amid the brouhaha that came with the release of political prisoners over recent months, other announcements were also made by the government which fielded much less coverage.</p>\n<p>This included the awarding 10 onshore oil and gas blocks, by the far the biggest tender, to companies that included Petronas, PTT Exploration &amp; Production and Jubilant.</p>\n<p>However, just like the opening-up of Vietnam and Laos at the end of the Cold War, Cambodia once its civil wars ended in 1998 or Thailand 30 years ago, Burma remains a legal and political minefield dogged by corruption. Transparency International ranks Myanmar at 180 equal with Afghanistan, one spot ahead of Somalia and two ahead of North Korea, considered the most corrupt country on Earth.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, rules and regulations are one of the biggest obstacles,” said one Yangon-based political analyst who declined to be named.</p>\n<p>“Here in Myanmar, there is no investment law, money exchange law, things like that. Nowadays, businessmen from abroad complain that there are no clear explanations for obstacles they face because there is no clear direction,” he said.</p>\n<p>Those laws are expected to be discussed and legislation passed by the Parliament in upcoming sessions and are sorely needed for all levels of an isolated society. Copyright infringement in the arts is another major issue.  Artists of all types, particularly musicians, have for years simply copied and sold works from abroad while claiming it as their own.</p>\n<p>Banks are also keen to get involved, in particular UK-based Standard Chartered, Bangkok Bank, Siam Commercial and Krung Thai. But the country lacks an independent central bank, nor has it fully recovered from the 2003 crisis when 20 private banks or informal financial companies went bankrupt.</p>\n<p>The black market flourishes on the dilapidated main streets of Yangon. Greenwood said another  major hurdle to stepping-up low cost industrialization to kick-start a moribund economy is Myanmar’s human limitations.</p>\n<p>Myanmar had a history of high quality English-orientated education but half a century of military rule resulted in the closure of the best universities and schools amid fears they would harbour student resentment and protests. According to Joshua Kurlantzick of the Council on Foreign Relations this was perhaps the most destructive blow dealt to Myanmar’s economic future.</p>\n<p>Greenwood was harsher.</p>\n<p>“The emerging population has been effectively uneducated, or even ‘diseducated’ – by the regime in what may be compared to a less bloody variant of the Khmer Rouge efforts to create supine, isolated and even physically weakened peasantry,” he said.</p>\n<p>One possible solution touted is the return of educated exiles. However, analysts doubted the release of dissidents, political reforms and the prospect that Aung San Suu Kyi will win a seat in Parliament at the April 1, by-elections would be enough to entice those living abroad with well paid jobs to return home.</p>\n<p>Despite the shortcomings, a business boom is already being talked-up. Last November the country’s industry minister declared the government was expecting an enormous inflow of foreign investment, mainly from Asia.</p>\n<p>The price of industrial land has reportedly quadrupled in parts of Yangon on the back of a rumor mill running hot on speculation about the development of satellite cities and large construction projects.</p>\n<p>Even the up-market travel agents are stepping in and offering boutique services out of Bangkok. One group, Khiri Travel,  is offering tours around the country in a private and of course luxurious jet.</p>\n<p>At US$8,500 a head a for four days and three nights, the company’s General Manager Edwin Briels, was optimistic in describing his target market as “high-end clients who want to be treated like millionaires” undertaking “one of the greatest little holidays in Asia”.</p>\n<p>Currently, Burma’s main income earners are a little more modest. Garments and tourism, alongside timber felling – an abomination among environmentalists &#8212;  and mining have provided limited financial returns for a government which has already privatized much of the country’s assets among the military.</p>\n<p>While comparisons with Thailand and Vietnam are understandable, the reality is Burma sits squarely behind Cambodia and Laos, which have been transformed by a decade of unprecedented growth with both countries establishing stock markets.</p>\n<p>“Myanmar could create a stock exchange within a couple of years but first it has to pass some new enabling laws,” said Doug Clayton, Chief Executive Officer of Leopard Capital, an investment fund that focuses on emerging markets.</p>\n<p>Clayton has followed Myanmar’s fortunes for more than two decades and said real estate, hotels and consumer goods usually led the foreign investment wave into transitional countries but such investors in Myanmar faced peculiar hurdles such as sanctions, uncompetitive foreign investment regulations and a bizarre official exchange rate system.</p>\n<p>“All this may rapidly change as Myanmar’s reforms continues but this is the reality as of today,” he said.</p>\n<p>His sentiments were echoed by Morten Pedersen who added the economics in the early days of development of such countries was more about politics and Myanmar had the potential to become a serious regional competitor in areas like garments once sanctions are lifted.</p>\n<p>“But this will take some significant progress in day-to-day governance, below the changes in ‘High Politics’ and governance approach that we are seeing at the moment,” he said, adding small investors were likely to see a quick rise in demand of the back of tourism.</p>\n<p>However, he added it would take some time before an expat community was established, if at all, to support the levels of Western-style bars and restaurants seen in the other major cities around the region that often find support among the foreign donor community and NGOs.</p>\n<p>“In fact, I am not sure this will ever happen – the Burmese are much more self-reliant and likely to continue to limit the role of aid agencies. And that’s a good thing, I think,” Pedersen said.</p>\n<p>Either way, analysts agree Myanmar as a development story could run for decades, the process will be long, at times arduous &#8212; and the returns could be great for Myanmar and business alike &#8212; if the reforms initiated by the civilian government after it came to power in November 2010 remain on track.</p>\n<p>This article first appeared in <em>Spectrum</em> magazine.

Another two have been arrested in Thailand, all in connection with a syndicate producing fake passports used to smuggle people across Asia and the Pacific. Luke Hunt reports.</p>\n<p>The arrests came after scores of refugees attempting the treacherous voyage to Australia were rescued by Aceh fishermen off the far northwest coast of Indonesia earlier this year. The crippled, overcrowded wooden vessel had a narrow escape with many of the passengers suffering from dehydration and exhaustion.</p>\n<p>The Rohingyas – Burmese Muslims – who were onboard were lucky because soon after, another boat sunk off the southern tip of Malaysia with at least eight lives lost.</p>\n<p>This tragedy came after some 200 people perished when their overloaded boat sank on the Java coast while en route to Australia in December.</p>\n<p>Despite these appalling conditions and ridiculous dangers, men, women and their children – mostly from countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran – risk all and embark on the harzardous journey. They believe the lies of secure passage spun by people smugglers.</p>\n<p>The relentless arrivals of asylum seekers off the Australian coast and the latest death toll are pressuring Australia’s two major political parties to find a solution which is proving to be elusive, particularly, after the Australian High Court struck down a refugee swap deal with Malaysia.</p>\n<p>Australian Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said the tragedies had underscored the need to find tough deterrents aimed at stopping the rush to Australia.</p>\n<p>“As we have consistently pointed out, the absence of a disincentive for boat journeys to Australia will mean people will continue to undertake these dangerous journeys,” he said.</p>\n<p>However, the temptation to play politics, an inability to find a bipartisan agreement and a stunning decision by the opposition leader Tony Abbot to turn the boats back, if elected, have again highlighted Australia’s inability to deal effectively with refugees and illegal immigration.</p>\n<p>The opposition conservatives are leading the government in the opinion polls, but Abbott has failed to capitalise on this, winning himself a reputation as being too negative after he opposed anything and everything put up by the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP).</p>\n<p>This has alienated him personally in an electorate which doubts his ability to think arguments through, instead of opting for a quick-fix policy made on the run. He has been dubbed “Dr No” by the local media.</p>\n<p>People smuggling is the Achilles heel of both parties, but Abbott’s policies are a legal nightmare and, if enforced, as absurd as it might sound, could amount to crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>It’s also the kind of bully-boy antics that Australia simply can’t afford in its relations with its neighbours.</p>\n<p>Abbott also expects the navy to carry out such a policy, even though this would fly in the face of every law of the sea, whether civilian or military, and leave him with little, if any, moral authority to lead.</p>\n<p>Senior naval personnel have already claimed that any decision to turn away any boat must be left to the commander involved while Abbott insists it is the navy’s duty to carry out orders from the government of the day.</p>\n<p>Men and women join the armed services to protect their country, an admirable career choice, not to turn impoverished civilians in a leaky boat seeking help and asylum back out to sea.</p>\n<p>It’s against the law and, if elected, Abbott could risk becoming the first Australian prime minister to risk a mutiny.</p>\n<p>Any such policies would also create an enormous backlash from Jakarta, a key transit point for people smugglers and where Indonesians find it difficult to comprehend Australia’s harsh attitudes to asylum seekers.</p>\n<p>Many there believe Canberra is seeking to abrogate its responsibilities, attempting to offload its international obligations onto its poorer neighbours.</p>\n<p>The smarter people in Abbott’s Liberal Party recognise this. Opposition Immigration spokesman Scott Morrison sought a more humane line when commenting on the latest sinking, saying the focus should be on the rescue effort.</p>\n<p>“Sadly these events have been occurring for years. The coalition remains as committed as ever to the policies we believe will have the right impact on preventing these tragedies,” he said.</p>\n<p>Exactly what those policies are remains to be seen, more than a decade after boatpeople began arriving from the Middle East and Central Asia.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; Four people who arrived in Australia by boat have been charged with people smuggling.

Its infrastructure was in ruins and utilities like the colonial-era water supply were in a state of filthy disrepair.</p>\n<p>The ideology of the ultra-Maoists also left 1.7 million people dead and obliterated Khmer culture. Even money was abandoned as an agrarian utopia based on self-reliance was attempted.</p>\n<p>It failed and 33 years later the historical ironies of Cambodia&#8217;s past are becoming all too evident.</p>\n<p>Industries such as tourism and garment production are booming. Mining is taking off and the Cambodian Stock Exchange (CSX) is finally up and running after a 10-month delay with Phnom Penh Water Supply (PPWS) its first listing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;PPWS is considered one of the best managed state enterprises in Cambodia. Phnom Penh is one of the only cities in Asia where it is safe to drink water out of the tap,&#8221; said Doug Clayton, CEO of the frontier investment fund Leopard Capital.</p>\n<p>That reputation was hard earned in a country renowned for corruption (164th on Transparency International&#8217;s perceptions of corruption index last year).</p>\n<p>What changed PPWS was the appointment of Ek Sonn Chan as director back in 1993. Given the mission to provide the city with clean, affordable drinking water, he began by building a performance-based corporate culture.</p>\n<p>Practices that allowed jobs for life, along with jobs for friends and relatives, were ditched. Staffing levels were cut by 80%. Those who remained were paid high salaries but told they would be dismissed if they failed to measure up.</p>\n<p>Two factors contributed to the company&#8217;s success. First Sonn Chan obtained the implicit backing of Prime Minister Hun Sen who supported his plan to run PPWS as an autonomous body. Second, he tugged on the emotional heartstrings of donors who had begun entering the country as part of a UN bid to rebuild it.</p>\n<p>Sonn Chan&#8217;s entire family had been killed by the Khmer Rouge and with missionary zeal he told his story, then the stories of millions of Cambodians who were still suffering because they had been denied access to clean water.</p>\n<p>Waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery and typhoid were common.</p>\n<p>His pleas were heeded and a US$110-million package involving loans and grants was put together by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, French and Japanese governments.</p>\n<p>Old pipes were replaced and the network extended by more than 1,000 kilometres. Treatment plants were upgraded and a metering system introduced with payments enforced.</p>\n<p>Unpaid bills resulted in disconnections. Subsidies allowed access to clean water for the poor. Illegal connections that once sold for $1,000 each are now unheard of and lost water or non-revenue water (NRW) is now around 5% compared with 75% in past years.</p>\n<p>The company calculates that one percent of its annual water supply costs $50,000 to produce. This means a 10% reduction in NRW can generate a surplus of $500,000. The average NRW in Southeast Asia is 25% while in Cambodia it&#8217;s among the lowest in the world.</p>\n<p>According to scientific data and independent tests by authorities in Singapore, Phnom Penh&#8217;s water supply has been safe to drink out of the tap since 2003.</p>\n<p>Sonn Chan says the stock market listing has taught him and his staff a lot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We never knew what a stock market was. We started from zero. Our employees who were tasked with this job had to work and study hard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was really difficult for us and we are really happy with what we have achieved.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2004 the ADB awarded Sonn Chan its Water Prize, two years later he won a prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for government service and he has been declared a &#8220;water hero&#8221; by Hun Sen.</p>\n<p>And there was a vote of Western confidence. The Cambodia Beverage Company (CBC) _ the exclusive bottling partner of the Coca-Cola Company _ conducted its own tests, declared the water fit and substantially expanded its operations in 2004.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There must be transparency and we must take that responsibility,&#8221; Sonn Chan said, adding that water systems outside Phnom Penh remain in very bad shape, particularly in the remote provinces.</p>\n<p>Money raised from the share float will be used to expand the water distribution network.</p>\n<p>On the first day of trade PPWS stock surged almost 50% after the government floated a 15% stake at $1.57 each. Mr Clayton said the sharp rise was largely due to the excitement associated with the new market and he cautioned that &#8220;although PPWS is a well-managed company it is still just a regulated utility business, not a high-growth stock&#8221;.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; When the Khmer Rouge were driven out of Phnom Penh in 1979 they left behind a city that had been laid bare.

Luke Hunt reports.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Understandably, the shooting of Chhut Vuthy, 45, in a remote southern forest has outraged human rights groups and despite 14 years of peace has also reinforced perceptions of Cambodia as a lawless country still at war with itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But his death has wider ramifications and what exactly happened may never be known.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chhut Vuthy was founder and director of the Natural Resource Protection Group, a small NGO dedicated to saving what&#8217;s left of Cambodia&#8217;s forests.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to his friend Seng Sokheng of the Community Peace Building Network, Chhut Vuthy had decided on a trip to Koh Kong to investigate &#8220;forest crimes&#8221;. The pair had worked together often and they wanted to capture illegal loggers on video.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The target was a heavily forested area near a dam being built by the China Huadian Corporation (CHC) at Stung Ressey Chrum Krom. The dam is one of four hydropower projects to be built in Koh Kong, labelled by Prime Minister Hun Sen as &#8220;a battery province&#8221;. CHC officials had not commented on the killing by the time Spectrum went to press.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The projects have drawn widespread criticism due to the impact the dams could have on the livelihoods of local villagers, the Southern Cardomam&#8217;s Protected Forest and wildlife in the area.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Protecting the forest is like protecting our rice pot,&#8221; Seng Sokheng told Spectrum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chhut Vuthy loaded up his Land Cruiser, picked up two journalists from The Cambodia Daily _ local reporter Phorn Bopha and her Canadian colleague Olesia Plokhii, both 27 _ and headed for the area, well known among environmentalists as a favourite for illegal loggers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Along the way Chhut Vuthy was spotted taking photographs without permission and this, according to military police spokesman Kheng Tito, had prompted a complaint from the CHC.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On April 26 the burgundy Land Cruiser was travelling to Koh Kong when Chhut Vuthy decided to stop at a village in Mondol Seima district.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to an extract published by The Cambodia Daily, Chhut Vuthy told the journalists they would not be welcome.

The soldiers demanded the three stay put until they had spoken with their superiors but they refused to say whether they worked for the government or a private company.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At that point Chhut Vuthy attempted to get back into his car but was physically prevented.

The two women then asked the soldiers to let them leave and noted they were on a public road.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another three soldiers, all armed with AK-47s, arrived on motorcycles, one smelled of alcohol and told Chhut Vuthy he was to go with them and meet &#8220;the boss&#8221; in Koh Kong city. The stand-off became tense, Plokhii attempted to take photos and as a soldier wrenched the camera from her, Phorn Bopha was accidentally struck on the lip.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chhut Vuthy announced he was going to leave. Plokhii got into the front passenger seat and Phorn Bopha sat in the back, The Cambodia Daily reported.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A scuffle broke out and Chhut Vuthy&#8217;s shirt was ripped while another camera belonging to Plokhii was snatched from the back of the car. At this point the soldiers relented and Chhut Vuthy got into the car and attempted to start the engine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hoping to push-start the car, he asked the women to get out and push but in the meantime the soldiers returned, another argument followed and Chhut Vuthy was accused of being rude and arrogant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to The Cambodia Daily report one of the soldiers said to Chhut Vuthy: &#8220;We are both slaves, we are both the same. Don&#8217;t be so arrogant.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;I&#8217;m a slave to who?&#8221; Chhut Vuthy replied loudly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Then a soldier noticed a third camera in the car. When it was handed over, tensions eased somewhat and with Plokhii&#8217;s help Chhut Vuthy then attempted to start the car with jumper leads. Phorn Bopha wandered around the village. The Land Cruiser started. Chhut Vuthy closed the bonnet and they started to leave, but each time he turned the key a soldier leaned over and turned the engine off. Chhut Vuthy shouted to the journalists to get in the car as the soldiers retreated slightly. Again the car started and the three began to leave when the soldiers blocked their exit.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sitting in the rear was Phorn Bopha who was on the phone to Kevin Doyle, the editor-in-chief of The Cambodia Daily. The sounds of two gunshots rang out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Neither journalist saw what happened next, but according to an autopsy Chhut Vuthy was struck in the knee by a bullet from an AK-47. It ricocheted into his stomach and he died a short time later.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two women bolted into the bush where they hoped locals would hide them. According to Phorn Bopha she heard soldiers discuss what to do next. This included moving the car and the body off the side of the road and into the forest where it would not be found.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They then discussed the two journalists and one soldier said chillingly in Khmer: &#8220;Just kill them both.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eventually, more police arrived and the pair were held for questioning and released the next day but fears remain for their safety.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kheng Tito, the military spokesman, said the bullet that killed Chutt Vuthy was fired by 32-year-old soldier In Rattan and realising what he had done he turned the assault rifle on himself, pulling the trigger twice with bullets entering his abdomen and chest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;Vuthy and Rattana died from the same kind of bullets. In short, Rattana fatally shot Chhut Vuthy and shot himself to death,&#8221; he told Spectrum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Case closed, according to the authorities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, what they failed to comprehend was the deep outrage his death would cause.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chhut Vuthy was extremely popular within the small world of NGOs and something of a media darling who worked tirelessly with local and foreign correspondents. His family insisted a third person was involved with the deaths and have demanded a full investigation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a separate, unconfirmed report, The Phnom Penh Post said Chhut Vuthy had been stopped by staff from a company called Timbergreen which has the licence to clear land at the dam site. It quoted sources and also said that Ran Boroth, a Timbergreen official, had reportedly been arrested as a suspect in the shooting of In Rattana.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chutt Vuthy&#8217;s death was the highest profile killing in Cambodia since the assassination of trade union leader Chea Vichea. He was shot dead in 2004, and two men widely believed to be innocent were jailed. Then in February, three women who were campaigning for improved working conditions at a factory which supplies the German sportswear giant Puma were shot.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The three survived but alleged gunman Chhouk Bandith, a district governor, has since been charged with the relatively minor offence of causing &#8220;unintentional injuries&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Naly Pilorge, director of of Cambodia&#8217;s pre-eminent human rights group the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights, said the authorities had put forward at least two different versions of the events leading to the deaths of Chhut Vuthy and In Rattana, &#8221;all of which contradict information we have collected&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8221;The murder marks the seventh time since November, 2011, that state security forces around the country have opened fire during protests or on Cambodian citizens exercising their civil rights,&#8221; she said. &#8221;All of the perpetrators appear to have acted in the course of protecting business interests.&#8221;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EU said it was deeply concerned, describing Chhut Vuthy as a &#8221;well-known environmentalist and human rights defender&#8221; adding the EU had witnessed &#8221;an increased use of force, particularly the use of firearms&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It urged the Cambodian government to take all necessary measures to protect those &#8221;who seek to advocate peacefully for all legitimate causes, including the protection of the invaluable natural resources of Cambodia&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prime Minister Hun Sen, at an annual Asean summit just over a month ago, told 200 journalists that Cambodia had improved rapidly with more than a decade of peace behind it, and that he alone was in control of his nation&#8217;s armed forces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the time it was seen more as an electioneering stunt. However, scholar and veteran campaigner, Lao Mong Hay, of the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights, said Hun Sen only commands the armed forces in law. He requires their support and &#8221;he has been in a way held hostage by them&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8221;They have been able to abuse their power to have and then maintain a high lifestyle. Chhut Vuthy&#8217;s death, as indeed other similar deaths such as that of trade unionist Chea Vichea&#8217;s, has clearly shown how far the powerful are prepared to go to protect their own interests and those from who they are receiving benefits, that is, the rich,&#8221; he told Spectrum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the same Asean press conference, Hun Sen _ who has promised a full inquiry into the incident _ went to great lengths to rebut claims that his government was being goaded into doing China&#8217;s bidding amid billions of dollars in foreign aid from Beijing.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yet Chutt Vuthy&#8217;s death followed an order from CHC _ among China&#8217;s top five energy producers _ to stop him from taking unwanted photographs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Seng Sokheng says he has no doubts that his friend and colleague was indeed targeted by the rich and powerful around the dam site being built by CHC at Stung Ressey Chrum Krom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But he remains defiant and with shades of Chhut Vuthy he added: &#8221;His death is a threat to other forest activists in Cambodia. But we are not in fear, we are not worried. We will continue our work.

His style of autocracy has never been far from the surface of Malaysian political life and was again on display in Kuala Lumpur in recent weeks when political mischief went on show in the guise of putting Western leaders in the dock through a court with no jurisdiction or legitimacy other than it being backed by Mahathir, who attended the hearings.</p>\n<p>As an eye witness to war in Afghanistan and Iraq and the wanton destruction caused elsewhere by the War on Terror, I can testify to the sheer ferocity of the conflicts.

Cambodia rose to 117, while Brunei reached 122 and Malaysia came in at 125.</p>\n<p>Singapore and Thailand improved to 135th and 137 respectively, The Philippines came in at 139<sup>th</sup> and Laos sat at 165. Oppression in West Papua resulted Indonesia falling to 146<sup>th </sup>spot.</p>\n<p>With 10 deaths Pakistan may have been the deadliest for the second year in a row but at 151 it was not among the worst performers in the region. Burma improved amid political reforms and at 169 fared better than Vietnam at 172, China in 174<sup>th</sup> spot and North Korea at 178, just above Eritrea at the bottom of the index.</p>\n<p>This year hasn’t exactly got off to the best of starts either. Since the report was released Pakistani journalist Mukarram Khan Atif, from Voice of America, has been shot dead by the Taliban who have declared they will kill reporters deemed working for any anti-Talib group.</p>\n<p>In Sri Lanka, which fell to 163<sup>rd</sup>, journalists are staging protests demanding the government launch an investigation into the killing and disappearance of reporters, which have grown in number. In Somalia Osman Abdi of Shabelle Media became the first journalist to be shot dead in that country for 2012.</p>\n<p>In Ethiopia three journalists have received lengthy prison terms under that country’s draconian anti-terrorism laws. And in China authorities have blocked foreign journalists from entering areas where Tibetan exiles claim 136 Tibetans have been arrested or have disappeared while in police custody in Sichuan, bordering Tibet.</p>\n<p>However, the latest out of Burma is that the government of President Thein Sein has begun easing restrictions on foreign journalists entering the country as locals gear up for the April 1 by-elections which should see opposition leader and pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi elected to Parliament.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on a slightly stranger note, Malaysia’s First Lady Rosmah Mansor has won herself a colorful reputation. Her concerns for the environment has steered her towards buying-up tracts of rainforests, she also has a hard head for cutting a business deal and her concern for a murdered Mongolian model deeply touched many Malays.</p>\n<p>Two Malaysian officers are awaiting execution for the murder of Altantuya Shaarribuu, who once worked for Rosmah’s husband Prime Minister Najib Razak as a translator. Forensic tests showed that she was first shot in the head, then her body blown to pieces with C4 explosives.</p>\n<p>Never far from the limelight, the First Lady of Malaysian Politics, has become famously upset with one Australian journalist who detailed her shopping habits which placed her squarely in the same ranks of another accomplished first lady, Imelda Marcos of The Philippines.</p>\n<p>Writing in the<em> Sydney Morning Herald</em> columnist Andrew Hornery dubbed Rosmah the “first lady of shopping” after she apparently racked up bills totalling A$100,000 in a Sydney shop. He quoted local frock designer Carl Kapp as having spent the tidy sum during a private holiday.</p>\n<p>“In recent months, Mansor&#8230; has been forced to deny reports she had bought a US$24 million diamond and a US$200,000 (RM621,000)-plus crocodile skin, bejewelled Hermes handbag,&#8221; Hornery added.</p>\n<p>Rosmah says it’s not true and journalists working in Malaysia’s traditional media and government friendly bloggers who share Rosmah’s famous thirst for fair play also retaliated, accusing Hornery of working for the opposition party in Malaysia and even denounced him as gay.</p>\n<p>Writing in mynewshub, blogger Melinda Mazhar went so far as to say: “Ii you surf the net looking for facts on Andrew, you would find that he has written many articles on gay rights and condemning those who ‘discriminate’ gays. So, no wonder Andrew feels so ‘close’ to our opposition which happen to be led by a gay guy too. And no wonder Datin Seri Rosmah had officially denied the shopping spree thing in no time at all as it’s nothing but another wild, unworthy, stupid gossip by Andrew Hornery.”</p>\n<p>That says it all, really.</p>\n<p>ENDS</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>AsiaWATCH &#8212; The Philippines improved a few notches while Pakistan cemented its reputation as the deadliest country on Earth for journalists and China and Vietnam both slipped amid increased arrests and tighter controls imposed on a <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/stilleto-media-mayhem-sydneys-swinging-handbags/\" title=\"Stiletto: Media Mayhem\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-05-26 08:18:33',8,2,12,'2012-05-26 08:18:33','2012-06-01 07:25:05'),(2249,2249,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/250px-Singapore_Skyline2.jpg','Defeat for Singapore’s PAP','2249','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The government and the People’s Action Party (PAP) in Singapore have been experiencing a rough patch.

This was borne out over the past two weeks, with Ieng Sary, 86, hospitalised for bronchitis and grinding the entire trial to a halt.</p>\n<p>The former foreign minister is considered the frailest of the three currently in the dock for genocide and crimes against humanity. His 80-year-old wife, Ieng Thirith, has already been ruled medically unfit for trial and remains in detention while undergoing further psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p>Doctors say Ieng Sary has stabilised but warned he also suffers from chronic health conditions, including heart and back problems, and this can only deteriorate. This has prompted the Open Society Justice Initiative, which is monitoring the trial, to suggest Ieng Sary might have to be severed from the process.</p>\n<p>His lawyer, Michael Karnavas, said his client did not want to hold up proceedings and had no objection to missing testimony from witnesses deemed less relevant. However, he added that Ieng Sary would not waive his right to be present during the hearings that touched on him either directly or indirectly.</p>\n<p>Tribunal spokesman Lars Olsen told Spectrum that Ieng Sary&#8217;s condition was a major concern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ieng Sary is recovering in the detention centre after having been discharged from hospital on Tuesday. We expect that he will be participating in the hearings starting from [tomorrow],&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Also before the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC) are Nuon Chea, the 85-year-old chief ideologue and No2 to Pol Pot, and Khieu Samphan, 80, a former head of state whose economic theories came into play after April 1975, when the ultra-Maoists won absolute control of what would become Democratic Kampuchea.</p>\n<div>All three deny charges of crimes against humanity and genocide.</div>\n<p>&#8220;We are of course mindful of the advanced age and health conditions of the accused persons, and the trial chamber is constantly working to ensure that the process can be as swift as possible,&#8221; Mr Olsen said.</p>\n<p>Ta Mok, a senior Khmer Rouge military figure, died aged 80 in 2006 while awaiting trial, and all remaining members of the Standing Committee which wrote and deployed Khmer Rouge government policy have died through age and illness or been killed in brutal factional brawling within their own ranks.</p>\n<p>Pol Pot died in 1998 while under house arrest imposed by Ta Mok.</p>\n<p>Significant changes have been made to speed up the trial process. Case 002 was split into several mini-trials, designed to make the proceedings more manageable, with the first trial to form some of the basis of subsequent trials.</p>\n<p>Mr Olsen added that two-way audio and video links in the holding cells in the basement of the courtroom had also helped, allowing the accused to participate remotely when ill health prevents them from sitting in the main courtroom.</p>\n<p>Ieng Sary&#8217;s medical exit followed another marathon session of sensational revelations of atrocities allegedly committed by Pol Pot and his henchmen between 1975 and 1979. Critical for the prosecution was how the regime had turned on itself.</p>\n<p>Among the most startling evidence was testimony that Nuon Chea had sent two nieces _ Lach Vary and Lach Dara, both Chinese-trained doctors who worked for the regime&#8217;s health ministry _ along with their husbands and another two nephews to the dreaded S-21 torture and extermination camp.</p>\n<p>It was also heard that Pol Pot had dispatched a sister-in-law to a security centre where she perished. It was a macabre game of one-upmanship, proving their loyalty by sending those closest to them to a horrible death in order to purify the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) of unwanted influences.</p>\n<p>Much of the evidence was produced by the prosecution&#8217;s star witness, Kang Guek Eav, also known as Duch, who was jailed for life in Case 001 after being found guilty of crimes against humanity and the deaths of at least 12,000 people at S-21, which he ran.</p>\n<p>The actual S-21 death toll has been estimated to be much higher, probably 24,000 people. Duch testified he had met regularly with Nuon Chea or Son Sen for updates on confessions and camp operations, a charge Nuon Chea has denied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I reported to him about the confessions, and he instructed and advised,&#8221; Duch said, adding that a typical meeting lasted 10 minutes and was held every three to five days. &#8220;The power was concentrated in the hands of the secretariat of the Communist Party, Pol Pot and Nuon Chea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Duch&#8217;s evidence was damning. He said in 1977 Nuon Chea had replaced Son Sen as head of Santebal _ the Khmer Rouge secret police. Son Sen survived the reshuffle of posts but was killed along with his family 20 years later amid a violent factional split.</p>\n<p>Favouritism was strictly forbidden and Nuon Chea had sought to prove his purity among the CPK by dispatching his own kin to the &#8220;killing fields&#8221;. His ruthlessness was corroborated by evidence from Saloth Ban, 67, who worked for Ieng Sary as secretary-general of the foreign ministry and was also Pol Pot&#8217;s nephew. He told the court that he was always terrified for his life and his immediate family, adding: &#8220;I had such fear, and I think others had bigger fear than me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said Pol Pot&#8217;s oldest sister-in-law, Khieu Thirath _ who is also the sister of Ieng Thirith _ was killed in a Khmer Rouge security centre.</p>\n<p>Khieu Thirath&#8217;s other sister, Khieu Ponnary, was the first Cambodian woman to receive a baccalaureate degree and had married Pol Pot in 1956 but she suffered chronic schizophrenia as the regime began to assert itself over the country.</p>\n<p>Others to perish as the regime turned on itself were members of the royal family headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the current king father, who initially supported the regime with China&#8217;s encouragement.</p>\n<p>Members of the Standing Committee like Vorn Vet, the deputy prime minister in charge of economy, and his entire family were also sent to S-21 where they were tortured and killed in the second half of 1978, just as the Vietnamese and Cambodian defectors were plotting their invasion.</p>\n<p>Further questioning of Duch by deputy co-prosecutor William Smith revealed Nuon Chea had ordered the executions of all remaining prisoners of S-21 in January 1979, as Pol Pot was hastily arranging a retreat into the countryside before the invading Vietnamese arrived in the capital.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There were more than 100 prisoners, even over 500, I feel,&#8221; the former mathematics teacher and born-again Christian said, adding the job was completed inside three days.</p>\n<p>He also added to previous testimony he gave in Case 001 incriminating Khmer Rouge superiors in the executions of Westerners _ an American, a New Zealander, an Australian and a Briton _ captured off Cambodia&#8217;s southern coast in 1977.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After the interrogations, there would be a decision to smash. The smashing was to be conducted in a form of burning to ash,&#8221; Duch said. &#8220;I was following the order from Nuon Chea, and I implemented the order.&#8221; The court had earlier heard how one of the Westerners was burned alive.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The decision to arrest was made by the Standing Committee in a broad sense, but in a more practical sense it was brother Pol who made the decision and in some cases brother Nuon was the one who made such decisions,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The Vietnamese-backed invasion forced the leadership into the remote countryside, where Duch informed Nuon Chea that the hasty retreat had meant he had left damning S-21 documents behind. This included hundreds of forced confessions and photographs of tortured prisoners that would eventually be used to secure the convictions against him in Case 001.</p>\n<p>Brother No2 was unimpressed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On my side, we destroyed them all. You were very bad that you could not manage this,&#8221; Duch quoted Nuon Chea as saying. They are still not on good terms and more recently Nuon Chea described Duch as &#8220;rotten wood&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The evidence has put the defence firmly on the back foot.</p>\n<p>Assuming Ieng Sary does overcome his health issues, the hearings at the ECCC will resume this week and a concerted counter-attack by counsel for the accused can be expected over the coming months.</p>\n<p>According to Mr Olsen this could continue into next year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is important however to be aware that the chamber cannot cut corners,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Just because the accused persons are of advanced age they are still entitled to enjoy the same fair trial rights as any other defendant.&#8221;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; With defendants before the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts well into old age and failing in health, efforts are being made to speed up the trial process amid shocking testimony of relatives sacrificed <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/krt-a-race-against-time/\" title=\"KRT, A Race Against Time\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-05-30 07:06:46',8,2,12,'2012-05-30 07:06:46','2012-05-30 07:06:46'),(2258,2258,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-400x266.jpg','Thailand&#8217;s Two Faces','thailands-two-faces','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Thailand hit the headlines twice this week.

Several Khmer contemporaries were assassinated and there were many sleepless nights from the top floor of his home and office in Street 264. Hayes literally slept one floor above the news room that produced every issue, once every two weeks.</p>\n<p>By the time I returned to Cambodia as bureau chief for Agence-France-Presse (AFP) in mid-2001, his marriage had collapsed and financial insecurity was a constant. The wars were over and efforts to put the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial were dominating headlines.</p>\n<p>In those days tribunal detractors were loud, not unlike now, and too often the people bellowing about the tribunal’s perceived inadequacies would hog the kind of attention that others thought belonged to Pol Pot’s many victims who had become an important part of the paper’s focus.</p>\n<p>As such, the <em>PPPost’s</em> reputation was largely borne out of the Khmer Rouge and how these ultra-Maoists wiped out a third of their own population between 1975 and 1979. But covering what had happened all those years earlier could prove tiresome, especially when seen through the prism of the late 1990s when a low-level civil war persisted.</p>\n<p>With conflict topping the agenda the economy became the most underplayed story in the country, particularly in light of the never-ending aftermath of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis which dominated news everywhere else in the region. Hayes often complained about the lack of economic coverage, and he understood the fiscal realities of the day first hand.</p>\n<p>During the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the newspaper, he quipped: “Basically I’ve spent the last 10 years not getting paid to worry about money every day, how this paper survived is an absolute mystery to me.”</p>\n<p>In his own words Hayes also “daydreamed about finding boxes of cash” and once told me that “if I had a buck for every time I worried about money I’d be a millionaire.”</p>\n<p>Things were tight but Hayes was also being modest.</p>\n<p>The secret of the <em>PPPost’s</em> survival and its great successes was largely due to Hayes’s ability to attract young and talented journalists who were prepared to live on a shoestring and work their hearts out. As a result the paper became a giant stepping stone to wider careers.</p>\n<p>The likes of Ker Munthit, Sarah Colm, Leo Dobbs, Liam Cochrane, Rob Carmichael, Nate Thayer, Matthew Granger, Jason Barber, Hurley Scroggins and Peter Sainsbury along with scores of other seasoned journalists have spent time at the <em>PPPost</em>.</p>\n<p>They earned rich praise from heavyweight academics and commentators including David Chandler, William Shawcross, Milton Osborne, Peter Maguire and Craig Etcheson and this would continue through much of the first decade of this century when news coverage changed dramatically.</p>\n<p>The US-led War on Terror had its own specific consequences on individual countries around Southeast Asia as al-Qaeda affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) made its presence felt with a series of bombings, like the 2002 Bali blast which left more than 200 people dead.</p>\n<p>In Cambodia the flak held added dimensions. Amid this post 9/11 atmosphere and its borderline paranoia, Phnom Penh was for the first time about to chair the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and host leaders from around the world. Conditions in the capital were rough, politicians blissfully ignorant of what was expected and Islamic extremists were using Cambodia as a hideout.</p>\n<p>The Bali bombing was masterminded by Hambali who had entered Cambodia after passing himself off as Thai, a decision he would later fear and regret, and he spent much of the year plotting that bombing from a guest house behind the Phnom Penh Mosque on Boeung Kak Lake, which is now little more than a very big sand pit.</p>\n<p>Following the blast Hambali held his ground in Cambodia until he panicked in late January 2003, after witnessing the whole sale destruction that erupted amid the anti-Thai riots that effectively shut down the country, spawning the memorable front page headline in the <em>PPPost</em>:  Mobs Go Berserk.</p>\n<p>Hambali fled and was soon captured in Thailand.</p>\n<p>A year later I was on Sabbatical, working regularly for the <em>PPPost</em> and investigating stories about hard-line Wahabi groups from Saudi Arabia allegedly funding Muslim Cham conversions and building opulent mosques in the Cambodian countryside where locals had known little more than traditional stilt houses and maybe a cow shed.</p>\n<p>During a series of interviews Cambodian Muslims came forward and told how they had been ordered out of the Madrassas in Southern Thailand where they had studied. Trouble was brewing and from his contacts in Thailand and Phnom Penh, Hayes had also heard of a military crackdown.</p>\n<p>The <em>PPPost</em> was all over the story and ahead of the game on the outbreak of a conflict that continues to this day, just as it had been during the years of civil war and when history was being written, such as the coup in 1997, Pol Pot’s death and the arrest of his cohorts.</p>\n<p>There were lighter moments, like the time Hayes confiscated a gun he gave to his guard after he was caught firing it at the next door neighbor’s property for target practice. The guard agreed to give it back and added the gun didn’t work anymore. He put it to his head and pulled the trigger, there was a bullet in the chamber but it had jammed.</p>\n<p>As AFP bureau chief from 2001 to 2004 the <em>PPPost</em> and its competitor <em>The Cambodia Daily</em> were highly prized sources of information. The Internet was only just making its presence felt as a news source and Cambodia as a hunting ground for journalists was all about primary reporting.</p>\n<p>This meant reporters had to spend time in the field. Good yarns didn’t arrive in press releases, government handouts, and junkets. To be fair this has not totally changed in Cambodia like it has in most parts of the world.</p>\n<p>But back then Phnom Penh was just a two paper town and the PPPost’s ability to produce highly informative, in depth articles without fear or favor was as appreciated as they were difficult to produce, and the staff on the paper held the respect of their peers and a community.</p>\n<p>ENDS</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; Twenty years ago Michael Hayes arrived in Cambodia with his life savings of about US$50,000 and his then-wife Kathleen just as the United Nations began pouring into the Southeast Asian nation to oversee elections <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/heydays-with-hayes/\" title=\"Heydays with Hayes\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-07-07 17:39:46',8,2,12,'2012-07-07 17:39:46','2012-07-07 17:39:46'),(2363,2363,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/800px-Scorpene_malaisien_vue_de_trois_quart_arriere_2-400x278.jpg','French Probe Upsets Malay Poll?','french-probe-upsets-malay-poll','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Since coming to power in April 2009, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak has used the threat of an early election to keep his political opponents at bay.

They were then flabbergasted as a tide of Western opinion turned on them.</p>\n<p><em>Luke Hunt reports.</em></p>\n<p>As time passed the imams of Vientiane&#8217;s two mosques thought those days had been consigned to history, particularly in Southeast Asia, where al-Qaeda affiliates were dealt with and mostly dismantled.</p>\n<p>But now both men are again looking on in horror at the treatment of Muslims, this time right next door in Myanmar, where close to 80 people have died in unrest between religions set off by the rape and murder in June of a Buddhist woman in Rakhine State in the west of the country. In retaliation, 10 Rohingya Muslims were lynched at the hands of an angry mob, and further attacks on Rohingya became widespread.</p>\n<p>Muhammad Rafi, of the Jamia Mosque is an outspoken native Myanmar Rohingya, while Muhammad Vina bin Ahmad, a Cambodian Cham, is the imam of the Azhar Mosque and a little more reserved. But both are at a loss to comprehend why Muslims in Myanmar are bullied and bloodied by their countrymen and threatened with expulsion from their own country by a government that prefers not to grant them their sovereign rights and would like to see them leave.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big, big problem,&#8221; said Mr Rafi with the help of a translator. &#8220;It&#8217;s no good and we&#8217;re not happy. We feel this because they are killing a lot of Muslims. No Muslim will be happy with this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He sits inside his mosque, flanked by two ultra-conservative Muslim Wahabis who are traditionally dressed in white. They are visitors from Saudi Arabia and  declined to give their names, saying only that they are tourists visiting regional countries. But they did say that Myanmar is ripe for international help.</p>\n<p>A state of emergency was imposed in June across the state of Rakhine following the violence. The New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused Myanmar authorities of shooting Muslims, committing rape and doing little more than standing by as mob attacks escalated.</p>\n<p>Myanmar President Thein Sein made an already bad situation much worse by insisting the Rohingya in Myanmar are not his compatriots and, despite centuries of carrying  out their Islamic traditions in Myanmar, they should be placed under the auspices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and shipped to a third country.</p>\n<p>This notion was rejected immediately by the United Nations and Washington.</p>\n<p>It was decided at an Extraordinary Summit of the Organisation of Islamic Conference in Mecca to take the Rohingya issue before the UN because of the continued &#8220;recourse to violence by the Myanmar authorities against the members of this minority and their refusal to recognise their right to citizenship&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Saudi Arabia has pledged US$50 million (1.57 billion baht) to aid the miserably impoverished Rohingya in Myanmar.</p>\n<p>The 67-year-old Rafi still has family in Myanmar caught up in the trouble and he dismisses vague attempts by some Buddhist historians inside his native land who are attempting to rewrite history with claims the Rohingya never lived in Myanmar before the 1950s, a contrived argument used to deny them citizenship.</p>\n<p>His family, mainly nieces and nephews, live in Palao in Rakhine state and have for generations. He says some have been forced to convert to Buddhism. Asked if a resolution can be found that would allow for a peaceful co-existence between Myanmar&#8217;s Muslims and Buddhists, he shakes his head and says: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That opinion was shared by the Wahabis and members of the Jamia congregation who had gathered around him.</p>\n<p><strong>HARMONIOUS FAITHS</strong></p>\n<p>Anti-Islamic hostilities in Myanmar stand in sharp contrast to the treatment of Muslims in Laos, who have citizenship and have found cultural acceptance in an overwhelmingly Buddhist country.</p>\n<p>Myanmar has about 800,000 Muslim Rohingya,  while Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand also have significant Muslim populations. Muslims in Laos are much smaller in number.</p>\n<p>Mr Rafi&#8217;s congregation of 500-odd souls is an ethnic mix from North Africa and the Indian sub-continent whose ancestry for centuries made their living in Laos by trading in textiles or butchering meat for local restaurants.</p>\n<p>Across town another 200 Muslim Chams thrive in a small industrial suburb. They began arriving here as refugees after April 1975, when the communist revolutions which had convulsed Indo-China for the previous decade entered into their final phase.</p>\n<p>Religion of all types was an anathema for the incoming communists, however, and some were less tolerant than others. The Cham fled as Cambodia was annexed by the Khmer Rouge, who initiated a fierce pogrom that annihilated perhaps 200,000 Muslim Chams.</p>\n<p>Their extermination is currently being examined as part of an international tribunal which has put Pol Pot&#8217;s surviving henchmen in the dock for crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>Upon arrival in Vientiane the Cham also found Laos in the final throes of a communist takeover by the Pathet Lao, and anxiety over the situation had forced many local Muslims to leave. But unlike the Khmer Rouge, Lao communists were relatively generous and fears inside the Islamic community proved unfounded.</p>\n<p>The long-standing attitudes of the authorities in Laos also stand in stark contrast to the more recent pronouncements by Thein Sein that have compromised his integrity, initially gained on the back of social reforms, the release of political prisoners including the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and April by-elections which marked her return from the political wilderness.</p>\n<p>In Laos, amid the chaos of communist takeovers in the region, the fleeing Cham found sanctuary and jobs. The children went to local schools while their parents built a mosque and _ importantly _ received citizenship.</p>\n<p>Mr bin Ahmad was coy on the subject, saying he did not like to discuss politics but adding that Muslims in Laos were happy and had no problems with the authorities or the overwhelming Buddhist population.</p>\n<p>Mr bin Ahmad said in broken English that there are problems in Myanmar but in Laos his congregation is safe and relations with the government are good.</p>\n<p>But outside his Azhar Mosque the ill-feeling toward Myanmar authorities is more vocal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to interfere in the politics of another country. We just want to keep the peace,&#8221; said Akmad Dokhan, a native Cambodian with Lao citizenship and fluent English. Mr Dokhan arrived in Laos in 1969 and later played an important part in re-settling Cambodian Chams who fled the Khmer Rouge, scrambled across the southern border into Laos and eventually made their way into the capital.

And as a recent conference on the problem made clear, it&#8217;s a trend that&#8217;s spreading throughout the developing world. Luke Hunt reports</strong></p>\n<p>Land grabbing has emerged as the biggest blight to afflict Cambodia in recent years. Thousands of villagers have been pushed off their family plots for what they say is too little compensation as big corporations move in with the government&#8217;s blessing.</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of complaints or protests, particularly in the district courts. In Bavet, near the Vietnamese border one woman says her family was chased off their property by politically connected neighbours armed with guns and knives who then turned their land into an access road.</p>\n<p>Another woman is forced to work in a clothing factory to make ends meet after business interests bought up district land and blocked access to public irrigation water, meaning her family could no longer grow rice. An offer was then made to buy their useless plot at a reduced price.</p>\n<p>Enormous concessions have been granted to Malaysian palm oil plantation barons, Chinese developers, Russian timber merchants and Australian miners.</p>\n<p>According to human rights group Licadho, about 2.1 million hectares _ an area about the size of Wales _ has been transferred in Cambodia from subsistence farming to large industrial firms since 2003, affecting 400,000 people.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an enormous issue that is also affecting Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and Laos, where dam construction _ at least 12 of them are planned for the lower Mekong River _ is threatening to push villagers off their traditional lands on an unprecedented scale.</p>\n<div>&#8221;There is actually nothing new in this. Land grabbing has been happening for hundreds of years. The British did it in India, the Spaniards in the Philippines and the French here in Cambodia, now we&#8217;re doing it to ourselves,&#8221; said Seema Gaikwad, Asian regional coordinator for the International Land Coalition.</div>\n<p>&#8221;It&#8217;s another type of colonisation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Human rights activists, anti-logging environmentalists, journalists, bloggers, politicians and in particular ordinary villagers have been killed, jailed and exiled simply for speaking out over the issue.</p>\n<p>In Cambodia, leading environmentalist Chhut Vuthy was killed in April during confrontations with the Cambodian authorities over land, and a 14-year-old girl was shot dead in May during an eviction of 1,000 families, causing an international outcry.</p>\n<p>In Ho Chi Minh City, three Vietnamese bloggers were recently jailed for their coverage of a range of issues, including land grabbing. In India last week, 50,000 people angered by official silence on the issue marched 350km from the central city of Gwalior to Delhi demanding land reform.</p>\n<p>The silencing of critics was a recurring theme at last week&#8217;s Asian Land Forum in Phnom Penh, a timely event given the jailing of Mam Sonando for 20 years after Prime Minister Hun Sen alleged the Cambodian broadcaster was behind a secessionist plot. Human rights groups were far from convinced and say his incarceration had more to do with his criticisms of huge land grants.</p>\n<p>&#8221;It&#8217;s happening the world over. In Africa we&#8217;re seeing people being pushed off their land and into menial jobs they would never even have thought of,&#8221; Ms Gaikwad said on the sidelines of the conference.</p>\n<p>&#8221;In India, Nepal and Bangladesh they are forced to move to places with no access to water, electricity, education or hospitals. It&#8217;s the loss of their cultural identity,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Each year we hand governments recommendations and they don&#8217;t even look at them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Among those recommendations are transparency and the right to make informed decisions based on unfettered access to details involving land acquisitions, ownership titles and company records _ conditions that require a free press and the political will to implement and enforce laws.</p>\n<div>\n<p>The overwhelming number of complaints of land grabbling have prompted the international development agency Oxfam to urge the World Bank to temporarily freeze all investments involving land while it reviews its procedures to ensure the rights of impoverished land holders are not ignored.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Oxfam said Liberia had seen 30% of its land swallowed-up in just five years and the agency has also been threatened with expulsion from Uganda after accusing the government there of allocating large parcels of land to big corporations.</p>\n<p>Oxfam calculated that land deals had tripled world-wide after food prices hit record highs in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008. Importantly, according to Oxfam, nearly 60% of investments in agricultural land by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010 have been to grow crops that can be used for biofuels, adding further upward pressure to food costs.</p>\n<p>Now, Oxfam says, another global wave of land grabbing is beckoning with the cost of food again nearing peak levels.</p>\n<p>Norly Grace Mercado, East Asia coordinator for Oxfam, said the face of land grabbing had changed from the Conquistadors of old to commercial plantation owners, and the rush for land had intensified over the last three years, forcing prices to rise significantly.</p>\n<p>To put this in perspective, she quoted figures from the Asean Secretariat. In 2010, a whopping US$74 billion worth of foreign direct investment was pumped into the Southeast Asian land market, up almost 95% on the previous year.</p>\n<p>&#8221;It&#8217;s going to become a much bigger problem and get more complicated with business positioning ahead of 2015 when Asean is set to become a fully integrated economic community,&#8221; she told Spectrum from the sidelines of the conference.</p>\n<p>&#8221;No one strategy can fix this. It&#8217;s difficult. How do you introduce land reform in the Philippines when all the senators are landlords? There needs to be a series of strategies that deal with policies, laws, implementation, community involvement and independent monitoring.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This kind of thinking is winning attention. In Geneva on Wednesday, Cambodian monk Luon Sovath (Pictured) received the Martin Ennals Award from human rights groups for his stand against forced evictions, a cause he rallied to after witnessing family and friends being evicted from their homes in 2009.</p>\n<p>Luon Sovath has faced threats of arrest and disrobing while maintaining a non-violent Buddhist approach using videos, songs and poems to defend traditional rights to a home.</p>\n<p>Among his concerns is the creation of an underclass. Landless and denied traditional access to a home, many people have no choice but to find jobs in factories producing clothing for some of the world&#8217;s biggest brand names, including Levi Strauss, Gap, Puma and Adidas.</p>\n<p>Cambodia offers perhaps the cheapest labour pool in the world. A paltry minimum wage of US$90 (2,750 baht) a month has allowed factory owners, the brands and exporters to profit in an industry that earns about $1 billion a year, helped by generous no-quota access to European and US markets.</p>\n<p>&#8221;People are forced to take an occupation they are not skilled in, so they get paid as untrained labour for doing menial jobs they were provided with after being displaced,&#8221; said Ms Gaikwad, adding that conditions in such factories were often &#8221;pathetic&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The net result adds another layer to the existing cycles of poverty. Land grabbing is also providing Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen with a chronic political headache heading into the next election, due by mid-2013.</p>\n<p>Dave Welsh, country director for the American Centre of International Labour Solidarity, said most of Cambodia&#8217;s 400,000 clothing workers were internal migrants, and their displacement and low wages made it difficult to fight court battles over land disputes back in their home provinces.</p>\n<p>&#8221;The garment industry is the single largest industry in the country.

Among the most notable was a project in Vietnam to rescue bears from the barbaric practice of bile farming, where a catheter or a needle is inserted into their bile duct and the bile harvested to meet demand from the widely discredited Chinese medicinal market.</p>\n<p>It was a landmark project constructed by Animals Asia on six hectares of land in Vinh Phuc province in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam, where 104 rescued bears were given a home and some creature comforts after spending up to 30 years in captivity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The bears are being rehabilitated after years of trauma from being locked up in small cages and milked for their bile,&#8221; said Stuart Lennon, a spokesman for Animals Asia.</p>\n<p>Now they are being evicted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This will have a major negative impact on their mental and physical well-being. It is likely to take at least two years to establish a new centre with outdoor enclosures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These bears will be forced to return to cages to be relocated.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Animals Asia _ a charity that is devoted to ending bear bile farming practices and improving the welfare of animals in China and Vietnam _ has alleged &#8220;an aggressive campaign&#8221; had been undertaken by the director of the Tam Dao National Park, Do Dinh Tien.</p>\n<p>It says he deliberately spread misinformation _ in an attempt to block construction of the third outdoor bear enclosure _ saying that waste pollution from the rescue centre was damaging the environment and the health of the local community. &#8220;He requested that the Ministry of Agriculture close down the rescue centre and relocate the bears. Following an exhaustive investigation by the Vinh Phuc environmental department, the bear centre was cleared of all allegations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mr Lennon said Mr Tien, undeterred, had then lobbied Vietnam&#8217;s Defence Ministry to have the area declared of &#8220;national defence significance&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The park director has been pressuring Animals Asia to relinquish six hectares of land since April 2011. It is believed that he intends to hand the land over to the Truong Giang Tam Dao Joint Stock Company, in which his daughter has an investment,&#8221; Mr Lennon said. &#8220;The company has submitted an application for development of an eco-tourism park and hotels.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mr Tien was not immediately available for comment.</p>\n<p>Land grabbing and corruption is fast becoming a major social issue across Vietnam and Southeast Asia, and a source of illegal protests which has unnerved the authorities in Hanoi.</p>\n<p>Recently a group of former Viet Cong soldiers marched to Ho Chi Minh City, carrying a bust of Ho Chi Minh, to protest their eviction from land granted to them for fighting alongside the North Vietnamese communists during the Vietnam War.</p>\n<p>Anger over land grabs and corruption was nearing a fever pitch earlier this month _ when Animals Asia was handed its marching orders _ amid speculation the Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung could be ousted during a meeting of the Communist Party&#8217;s all-important Central Committee because of his links to corrupt businessman and collapsed state owned enterprises.</p>\n<p>That meeting lasted a marathon two weeks, twice as long as usual, and Mr Dung did hang on to his job. However, the Communist Party also acknowledged that corruption within its ranks was a problem.</p>\n<p>Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have also faced unprecedented international criticism for their inability to tackle the illegal wildlife trade. In July, the WWF singled out Vietnam as among the worst countries in the world for the illicit trade in animal parts, in particular rhino horn, amid rumours that it has healing and aphrodisiac properties.</p>\n<p>Bear bile is used for treating pain, fever, gall stones, inflammation and bad vision, although scientists say herbal and synthetic alternatives are also available.</p>\n<p>So accepted is the practice that Guizhentang Pharmaceutical _ a Chinese firm that sells bile extracted from the gall bladders of moon bears _ was included on a list issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission last year of companies seeking to make an initial public offering (IPO).</p>\n<p>The IPO was eventually withdrawn but only after animal rights activists highlighted the treatment by the company of 470 bears.</p>\n<p>More than 10,000 bears _ mainly moon bears which are also known as the Asiatic black bear, but also Malayan sun bears and brown bears _ are kept on bile farms in China. A further 2,400 are held captive in Vietnam where they are milked for their bile, which is stored in the gall bladder.</p>\n<p>In a rearguard action against their eviction, Animals Asia has enlisted celebrity support. British comedians and actors Ricky Gervais and Stephen Fry are sponsoring bears, narrating documentaries and drumming up support through social media networks.</p>\n<p>Animals Asia is also directly appealing to the prime minister to intervene and overturn the eviction order issued by the Agricultural Ministry on Oct 5. But Mr Lennon said that due to the powerful status of Vietnam&#8217;s Defence Ministry and the decision it made to re-zone the land, it was feared that the prime minister would be forced to agree with the recommendation to close the centre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The claim that the land in question is an area of national defence significance is questionable, given that the centre has been in operation since 2005 and that the Chat Dau Valley, where it is located, has been used for tourism and other private purposes since the park opened in 1996,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mr Lennon also said the eviction was in direct violation of a 2005 agreement struck between the Vietnamese government and Animals Asia to fund and develop the facility on 12 hectares of the Tam Dao National Park to permanently rehabilitate and house 200 rescued bears.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Based on this agreement, Animals Asia has invested more than US$2 million [61.4 million baht] in building and infrastructure,&#8221; he said, adding the closure would also see 77 local Vietnamese staff made redundant, while Animals Asia would incur losses of more than $2 million.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The local economy that depends on the centre would be severely impacted, and the Vietnamese government&#8217;s commitment to ending bear bile farming would be called into question,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>To date the Vietnamese government has been unresponsive. But if Hanoi is serious about dealing with the issue of land grabbing and cleaning up its reputation as a haven for the international and often illegal wildlife trade, then the prime minister might consider testing his powers against his country&#8217;s all powerful Defence Ministry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; Endangered species rescued from bile farms could now be evicted by authorities looking more to commerce than conservation, Luke Hunt Reports For years environmentalists have battled official corruption, ignorance and a plain lack of <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/bears-face-eviction/\" title=\"Bears Face Eviction\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-10-25 12:36:57',8,2,12,'2012-10-25 12:36:57','2012-10-25 12:36:57'),(2796,2796,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Happy-Wen-Jiabao.jpeg','Wen Jiabao&#8217;s Family Riches','wen-jiabaos-family-riches','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212;  The mother of China’s prime minister was a schoolteacher in northern China.

Luke Hunt Reports</em></p>\n<p>For weeks, Cambodians have filed into the capital, ending a pilgrimage which for most is a once in a lifetime event. The streets along the riverside are jammed with traffic while in the parks outside the Royal Palace children dressed in white with black ribbons play and pray with their parents.</p>\n<p>From a distance the palace gates _ adorned by portraits of the late King Father Norodom Sihanouk _ appear like an entrance to a castle in a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale. The palace is tastefully lit against the night sky, its spire pointing at the moon above and shrouded with smoke from the millions of incense sticks burning below.</p>\n<p>Sihanouk&#8217;s legacy is mixed. But as his people see it, he delivered them from Japanese occupation in World War II, won Cambodia independence from France eight years later and finally delivered peace after decades of bitter regional and internal conflicts.</p>\n<p>Sihanouk, who abdicated the throne in 2004 due to ill health, died at the age of 89 in Beijing in mid-October after reportedly suffering a heart attack.</p>\n<p>It is the kind of farewell that Sihanouk would have wished for _ emotional, convivial and forgiving of past sins.</p>\n<p>Outside the gates women, young and old, weep. Men tend to be a little more reserved. Expectations are that half of the country&#8217;s 14.3 million people will travel from all corners to pay their final respects by the time of the cremation in February.</p>\n<p>Among the crying women is Yan Sokha, 63, who travelled alone from the eastern province of Kampong Cham. She said she was shocked to learn of Sihanouk&#8217;s passing and had wanted to pay her respects for his soul.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Only the King Father could provide shade for his children. He rendered justice for the people. I want him to rest in peace and I would like to appeal to his soul, to help look after the Cambodian people as well. We want to live in harmony, together.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Khmers are also deeply religious _ outsiders might say superstitious _ when dealing with death. Importantly, rumours had circulated after he died on Oct 15 that the god-king was looking down upon his people from the moon. Sihanouk&#8217;s face was then seen in the moon and this was not without diplomatic incident.</p>\n<p>Wang Zia Chao, 43, a Chinese manager of a clothing factory was deported under rarely used lese majeste laws after she accused workers _ carrying poster-sized photos of the moon with late King Father embedded in it _ of shirking their responsibilities. She then enraged them by cutting up the pictures and 1,000 people went on strike, the police stepped in and even the Chinese government came down on the side of the Khmers.</p>\n<p>One Thai television reporter was wiser. Without thinking, she placed a photograph of Sihanouk on the ground while filing her report. That move underpinned another public outcry and a chorus of diplomatic complaints amid fears it could cause a repeat of the 2003 anti-Thai riots.</p>\n<p>A similar act in Thailand could result in jail time, but in Cambodia the reporter apologised profusely, and calm prevailed.</p>\n<p>Commemorations, the pomp and pageantry surrounding Sihanouk&#8217;s funeral are likely to outdo previous efforts. Numbers will also be bolstered by this year&#8217;s Water Festival, normally held at the end of November when up to two million people descend on the capital for the annual boat races. The festival itself has been cancelled but the holidays remain, offering villagers from the most isolated parts of the country a chance to pay their respects to the late king.</p>\n<p>The last royal funeral was for Sihanouk&#8217;s mother, Queen Sisowath Kossamak, who died in 1975 in Beijing where her son had lived in exile for five years following the Lon Nol coup. Her ashes were returned to Cambodia with Sihanouk with a dowdy Khmer Rouge escort.</p>\n<p>The funeral for his father King Norodom Suramarit in 1960 was a much grander affair. His death was accompanied by a salute from 66 cannons followed by three days of official mourning.</p>\n<p>The body was then transferred to the Preah Moha Montir Room, traditionally the resting place for deceased Khmer monarchs, for five months while local and international dignitaries, which included the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, paid their respects before a lengthy funeral procession and lastly the cremation in the park outside the National Museum.</p>\n<p>Sihanouk&#8217;s final journey will follow a similar path. After a week of mourning his embalmed body went on display. Dates for the final procession and cremation have not been announced, although Prime Minister Hun Sen has said the cremation would take place in February.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Khmers from all walks of life are patiently waiting for the palace gates to open, so they can file past the casket alongside other dignitaries and say their last goodbyes. Their patience is shared by King Norodom Sihamoni and the King Mother, Monineath, who have won the hearts of the nation by taking unannounced walks through the crowds.</p>\n<p>&#8221;I respect his son,&#8221; mourner Yan Sokha said. &#8221;We want to devote our hearts to him and I think he will be good because he is the son of the King Father.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another mourner, Toch Kan, 77, said his country had lost a great hero who stood up for the Cambodian people.</p>\n<p>&#8221;For the future, I would like the next leaders to follow his heroism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pheung Lot, 66, from Kandal province lit her incense sticks and prayed.</p>\n<p>&#8221;I prayed to his soul to bring happiness and harmony to the country and people. We lived with happiness during his rule,&#8221; she said referring to the 1950s and &#8217;60s when Cambodia experienced what many historians refer to as a &#8221;golden period&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8221;He was a smart king. I want Cambodia to have such a great king. I feel a deep regret in losing him. He is the one who brought independence and peace to the Cambodian people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Such thoughts were echoed across the lawns _ along with the odd concern for the future.</p>\n<p>Cambodia has gone through enormous changes since the last battles between government troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas were fought in 1998. Skyscrapers are being built, a stock market is up and running and business is brisk _ but a yawning wealth gap amid widespread complaints of corruption and land grabbing by the politically connected has tarnished the government&#8217;s image while enhancing the role of a monarchy, widely seen as impartial.</p>\n<p>Such concerns are more common among the young. Eighteen-year-old Noch Srey&#8217;s view was typical, saying the stability afforded by Sihanouk at a time of great uncertainty was the country&#8217;s biggest loss.</p>\n<p>&#8221;It&#8217;s worrying for the country because Cambodia is developing so fast and now we have lost a great, grand king, we don&#8217;t know what problems we will face in the future,&#8221; she said. &#8221;I just wish he could be here.&#8221;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; Half of the country&#8217;s population is expected to make the pilgrimage to Phnom Penh to pay their respects to King Father Norodom Sihanouk, demonstrating their reverence for him as well as their unease <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/a-kings-final-journey/\" title=\"A King&#8217;s final Journey\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2012-11-05 15:44:28',8,2,12,'2012-11-05 15:44:28','2012-11-05 15:44:28'),(2834,2834,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi-400x266.jpg','Burma: The Promise and Peril','burma-the-promise-and-peril','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Perhaps the most remarkable story in Southeast Asian affairs this last 18 months has been the largely unanticipated “opening up” of Burma, driven by President Thein Sein.

Major energy producers like Australia, Canada, Russia and central Asian countries are following the US lead with oil and gas once trapped in shale deposits now being accessed and fields once thought spent reopened.</p>\n<p>As a result, politically unsettled countries such as East Timor, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia are becoming much less attractive than they were five years ago when the price of oil was at its peak.</p>\n<p>East Timor has an added dilemma. This weekend an agreement with Australia expires and Dili must decide on whether to proceed with construction of an LNG processing plant with project operator Woodside Petroleum and the development of the Greater Sunrise field under a revenue sharing agreement with Australia.</p>\n<p>The sticking point is Dili wants the plant built on East Timorese soil, while Woodside argues this is neither economically viable nor technically advisable and it would prefer to see the processing plant built on a floating pontoon.</p>\n<p>Their issues go much deeper.</p>\n<p>With reserves worth perhaps $50 billion, Dili signed off on several resource sharing agreements with Australia in 2007. Through the Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) and the bilateral Timor Sea Treaty, which allocates revenue from the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) in the Timor Sea, East Timor receives 90% of the revenue while Australia gets the remaining 10%.</p>\n<p>Overlapping the JPDA is the Greater Sunrise field. About 80% of the field lies outside the JPDA and those revenues are to be shared evenly under the Sunrise International Unitization Agreement. These deals go back to East Timor&#8217;s early days as a nation and its dispute with Australia over control of the fields, which lie within East Timor&#8217;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p>\n<p>Damien Kingsbury, director of the Centre for Citizenship, Development and Human Rights at Deakin University in Australia, said there was no resolution in sight for the East Timor dispute, which is threatening to cancel Woodside&#8217;s involvement in the $20 billion project.</p>\n<div>East Timor can then opt out and under international law claim the entire area within the EEZ for itself. But finding another partner could prove difficult given weak market prices and the damage East Timor would do to its own business reputation by reneging on the CMATS.</div>\n<p>Agreements have already been signed by East Timor to provide gas to South Korea for an initial seven years while exploration deals have also been reached with Thailand.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Timor-Leste&#8217;s issues regarding Woodside are bigger than just immediate revenue access,&#8221; Mr Kingsbury said. &#8221;At stake [is] not just that issue, which may be able to be addressed later with a different partner, perhaps, but that over Timor-Leste&#8217;s sovereignty and maritime boundaries.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Turning positive exploration results from the Gulf of Thailand into a thriving commercial industry has also proved difficult amid maritime border disputes and control over oil deposits between Cambodia and Thailand.</p>\n<p>The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding for joint management of the Overlapping Claims Area (OCA) in 2001. A joint working group held talks until 2007 and two years later management of the OCA was put on hold by Thailand.</p>\n<p>Secret talks have continued in recent years, but according to Pavin Chachavalpongpun, lead researcher for political and strategic affairs at the Asean Studies Centre in Singapore, the OCA is a &#8221;very politically unpopular issue&#8221; in Thailand, and that compromise carries serious political risk.</p>\n<p>&#8221;I think an agreement on the street level is something that&#8217;s not palatable to the Thai public. Preah Vihear needs to be solved first,&#8221; he said, comparing the maritime issues with the border dispute around the 12th century temple ruins at Preah Vihear.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Californian-based oil giant Chevron estimated there were 400 million barrels, enough to earn Cambodia $1.7 billion a year, more than the government&#8217;s annual budget, but by 2009 as the fall in oil prices was whittling back profits it found the oil difficult to extract and scattered in pockets.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Hun Sen and his government&#8217;s oil policies were roundly criticised for lacking transparency, while onshore exploration had resulted in thousands of people being displaced and damage to protected wildlife areas.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, Hun Sen described such criticisms as &#8221;crazy&#8221; and forecasted oil would be extracted by 2012. To date nothing has been delivered.</p>\n<p>The maritime dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is not that different from the complexities afflicting the South China Sea, where China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping territorial claims.</p>\n<p>A decade-long attempt to build a consensus on a code of conduct for dispute resolution between China and members of Asean has persistently failed, and those efforts descended into acrimony last year when Cambodia attempted to mediate on a deal.</p>\n<p>One seasoned observer, who declined to be named, said ethnic conflicts in Myanmar, opposition to mining by the Catholic Church in the Philippines, political turmoil in Thailand and anger over environmental damage in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia by mining companies had weighed heavily on the industry.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Governments, like East Timor, had also been holding out for more money. Now they need to reassess and ask themselves why would an oil company want to invest in their country?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Perhaps ironically, had these disputes been settled a decade earlier _ as opposed to festering with no end in sight _ then Southeast Asian countries might have been in an ideal position to take advantage of fracking, which would suit their geological conditions.</p>\n<p>But as oil prices fall and the bickering continues, traditional producers are looking closer to home for cheaper and easier access to energy supplies through fracking _ and regional countries that have promised much now risk missing out altogether.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>From Luke Hunt ASIAWATCH &#8212; Impoverished countries hoping to strike it rich by developing their limited oil and gas reserves are being urged to move quickly or risk having their expectations clipped by fracking, which is <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/fracks-in-the-system/\" title=\"Fracks in the System\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2013-02-25 11:41:50',8,2,12,'2013-02-25 11:41:50','2013-02-25 11:53:40'),(3216,3216,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Burma-0080LH1.jpg','A Brave New Burma?','a-brave-new-burma','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Last November, President Obama visited Burma, meeting reformist President Thein Sein and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

For decades a Catholic church, possibly the oldest in the country, remained abandoned here as wars were waged for decades on the flat lands below.</p>\n<p>Under the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, churches _ alongside all forms of religious life _ were anathema and systematically destroyed, believers persecuted and clergy exterminated by the Communists.</p>\n<p>In Phnom Penh, the 19th century Notre Dame Cathedral became the first building to be razed by the ultra-Maoists, torn down brick by brick, after they entered the capital in April, 1975. Muslims were made to eat pork and targeted for ethnic cleansing while even Buddhism, the national religion, was outlawed as Pol Pot&#8217;s henchmen declared Cambodia would be driven back to Year Zero.</p>\n<p>The Bokor Hill Station did not escape the carnage. Thousands were marched off the cliff top _ 1,048m above sea level in the Elephant Mountains _ and to their deaths but the abandoned church, a casino, post office, villas and other colonial buildings survived the destruction.</p>\n<p>Then in the 1990s and early 2000s the hilltop became an isolated destination for the adventurous, accessible only by motorbike and four-wheel-drive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodia-2229LH.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3432\" alt=\"Cambodia 2229LH\" src=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodia-2229LH-102x150.jpg\" width=\"102\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodia-2229LH-102x150.jpg 102w, https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodia-2229LH-204x300.jpg 204w, https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodia-2229LH-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Cambodia-2229LH.jpg 1091w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 102px) 100vw, 102px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Historians lauded the place while a younger, more adventurous crowd held raves and full moon parties. That lifestyle and reverence stands in sharp contrast to more recent developments.</p>\n<p>Outside the church, and what remains of the older buildings, the signs attempt to deter overnight visitors. The more recent additions _ a big concrete Buddha and a gaudy new casino and entertainment complex _ would look more at home on the Las Vegas strip or in Macau than alongside an old French town.</p>\n<p>But Bokor is currently in the middle of US$1 billion (29.4 billion baht), 15-year construction programme by the Sokimex Group which holds a 99-year lease on the site. The initial stages of the massive casino project have been completed. Eventually the Thanksur Bokor Resort will cover most of the 105 hectare plateau with hundreds of villas, and include a sailing lake, a golf course and entertainment complexes.</p>\n<p>Speculation abounds over what might be built _ chairlifts, animal parks and a Ferris wheel among them.</p>\n<p>For many, the changes are the death knell of a bygone era deserving of preservation. For others not much has changed; Bokor is still a high society playground but in the 21st century it is being marketed for well-heeled Khmers with the French replaced by Chinese and Korean businessmen. And its raison d&#8217;etre _ a cooler climate offering some respite from the heat below _ is as strong a draw as ever.</p>\n<p>The Sokimex Group is predictably upbeat with statements such as: &#8221;We actually don&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a development _ we say it&#8217;s a rehabilitation because it already existed and we&#8217;re restoring it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company, with the blessing of Prime Minister Hun Sen, is also on record as saying the Thansur Bokor Resort focuses on three points: Nature, history and modern entertainment.</p>\n<p>Still, the post office and other buildings that sustained severe mortar damage during the war, were not restored and had to be pulled down about three years ago because they were deemed too dangerous for tourists.</p>\n<p>The first step in this &#8221;rehabilitation&#8221;, the building of a 33km road to the mountain top was widely applauded. The old road was dangerous and often subject to landslides.</p>\n<p>Locals believed it was haunted by the ghosts of about 2,000 prisoners who reportedly died of malaria and exhaustion after being forced to build the road by French colonialists.</p>\n<p>Back then, in the 1920s and &#8217;30s, Kampot was in its heyday. The Kampot River, connecting the town at the foot of Bokor with the Gulf of Siam, had become Cambodia&#8217;s first port.</p>\n<p>Hans von Zoggel, owner and manager of Villa Vedici, on the rural outskirts of Kampot said the French grandeur, its history and the almost constant mist shrouding the summit lent an eerie splendour to the area.</p>\n<p>This was helped by the plateau being declared a national park.</p>\n<p>However, more recent developments were designed to attract a different type of tourist, predominantly Asian high rollers and other wealthy people. He was scathing of the completed structures.</p>\n<p>&#8221;The design, style, location, colours and interior of the casino just look ugly, Mr von Zoggel said.</p>\n<p>&#8221;This is also feedback which I get from nearly all guests staying in the guesthouse,&#8221; he said, adding that although construction on the mountain top had not yet impacted on his business, he has doubts about the longer term future of the area.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Many people have come to Kampot to enjoy the slow and sleepy French old-style town, as it is often described in the brochures, and with Kampot changing due to the way Bokor is being developed, that audience may want to seek other places than Kampot,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>While the Sokimex Gorup continues to put its best spin on the redevelopment with lines such as: &#8221;We will have villas for people who treasure the tranquility and serenity of this unique sanctuary,&#8221; and, the group aims to &#8221;transform this unique five square kilometre picturesque mountain plateau into a resort for international and local tourists alike&#8221; _ others were not so sure.</p>\n<p>Architects and historians were reluctant to publicly criticise the project, possibly because of an inherent risk in upsetting the close knit circle of developers who have gained control of Cambodia&#8217;s reconstruction in the aftermath of its tragic wars. But they were critical nevertheless.</p>\n<p>One historian said he was always attracted to Bokor&#8217;s sparseness _ a landscape void of tall trees, covered by rock outcrops with a &#8221;wind-swept gnarled vegetation often shrouded in thick, grey mist&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8221;I would not have gone for the glitz and glamour of the current modern casino. The buildings that were there from the past almost form part of the scenery, stained with mosses and lichens &#8230; weather-beaten. New low-rise, cluster villa development in natural materials that would have fitted the landscape would be my choice,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day Bokor and its massive redesign, matched only by its lip service to appease the predominantly Western critics, is all about making money _ and lots of it _ and that means catering for thousands of gamblers at any given time. The national park status does not seem to matter.</p>\n<p>Founded by the Vietnamese-Cambodian businessman Sok Kong, Sokimex is a rarity in Cambodia &#8211; a genuine diversified conglomerate with assets in a range of industries, predominantly petroleum but also in property, garments and tourism, including management of the famous temples at Angkor Wat.</p>\n<p>The company has always been reluctant to provide any market information on its profit or loss levels, a point that has always annoyed potential investors after Sokimex insiders flagged the prospect that it could attempt a listing on Cambodia&#8217;s fledgling stock market. That secretiveness has also allowed rumours to flourish and cast doubts over the remaining French buildings.</p>\n<p>&#8221;From what I can see little of the old remains _ except the hotel, church and a few structures that were re-used,&#8221; the historian said. His sentiments were echoed by Mr von Zoggel who added that Sokimex risked alienating Bokor&#8217;s traditional market.</p>\n<p>&#8221;Kampot is also attractive for Phnom Penh expats who want to escape the capital. If Kampot is getting busier due to the Bokor developments, then this specific group may also change.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bokor&#8217;s $1 billion ground-up construction must succeed if Sokimex is to successfully list. The company will also have to disclose its longer term plans and distinguish itself from being just another gambling haven _ whether inside Cambodia or around the region in places like Macau, Singapore or Myanmar _ if it is to attract the numbers needed to turn a profit.</p>\n<p>That distinguishing difference might just lie in Bokor&#8217;s French heritage _ or what&#8217;s left of it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>ASIAWATCH &#8212; Architects and historians say a conglomerate&#8217;s US$1 billion plan to build a gaming centre on Bokor Hill could mean it losing its unique French heritage, Luke Hunt Reports.

He was 52. Valdiviezo, who was a radio and TV reporter, was killed by a gunman after leaving his mother’s house where he had dinner.</p>\n<p>Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa pledged those responsible would be brought to justice. He was the 10th journalist killed in Latin America this year, three in Brazil, two in Guatemala, and one each in Haiti, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Ecuador.</p>\n<p>Also dead is the Russian journalist Mikhail Beketov Technically he died from heart failure while choking on his lunch. Bound to a wheelchair and unable to speak, Beketov was beaten senselessly five years ago after exposing local corruption. Fingers and a leg were amputated as a result.</p>\n<p>His death came as the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ) learned Somali journalist, Mohamed Hassan Habeeb, who was a media advisor to the courts and had worked several media houses including the state run Radio Mogadishu, had been killed during an attack on a court.</p>\n<p>His death brought the number of journalists killed in Somalia this year to three.</p>\n<p>Another country winning unwanted attention is Malaysia.

He did win the contest and ensured the 56-year unbeaten run by the Barison Nasional (BN) coalition as the nation’s leaders would continue.</p>\n<p>However, Chinese voters deserted the coalition in droves, reduced the ruling party’s majority and left Najib’s One Malaysia campaign – designed to show-off the country’s racial harmony &#8212; in tatters.</p>\n<p>Najib said he had been hit by a “Chinese tsunami”. As such his stewardship can no longer be guaranteed and a leadership challenge, most likely from his upstart deputy Muhyiddin Yassin, seems inevitable.</p>\n<p>Equally opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim struggled. Promises of a sweep into power and ridding the country of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) – the party of native Malays, Najib and the rulers of BN since independence in 1957 – failed to materialize.</p>\n<p>His standing and that of his Pakatan Rakyat (PR) did improve, just, with the party picking up a morale-boosting majority of the overall vote but he has again proved incapable of mustering a broad-based political support network capable of handing him a substantial mandate to govern.</p>\n<p>“Barisan Nasional has achieved victory without a popular mandate, the Pakatan Rakyat defeat was without moral loss. Both now seek explanations for their failures,” said Gavin Greenwood, a regional risk analyst with Hong Kong-based Allan &amp; Associates.</p>\n<p>“Malaysia now faces the prospect of a period, at best, characterized by mutually hostile political confrontation,” he said.</p>\n<p>That hostile reaction has already taken to the streets with 50,000 people clad in black ignoring police and government warnings by rallying at the Kelana Jaya sports stadium in Selangor against gerrymandering that favors Malays in rural areas, election irregularities and allegations of cheating.</p>\n<p>These included allegations of people voting more than once, vote buying, citizenships granted in return for votes, electoral roles loaded with the names of dead people, and the transporting voters around the country to ensure their ballots were cast.</p>\n<p>Complaints while voting were common. While standing at one polling station an elderly woman held out her finger. She had just voted and the finger was only partially covered in the indelible ink designed to limit fraud and stop people from voting more than once. The ink is supposed to last a week.</p>\n<p>“Look,” she said while rubbing her fingers. “It washes off in the rain.”</p>\n<p>On social media sites Malaysians have taken to blacking out there profile pictures while counting continues with BN’s overall vote falling to 46.53 percent from just over half recorded at the 2008 poll when the UMNO-led BN lost its cherished two-thirds majority in Parliament.</p>\n<p>That majority had enabled a generation of prime ministers to pass laws which favored bumiputeras – native Malay Muslims predominantly from West Malaysia &#8212; over Chinese, Indians and other ethnic and indigenous groups who belong largely to the Buddhist, Hindu and Christian communities.</p>\n<p>They were enforced after the 1969 race riots when Malay mobs went on a rampage, killing hundreds, after election results did not go their way.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the loss of that two-thirds mandate prompted Najib to move, in April 2009, ousting his predecessor Abdullah Ahmad Badawi amid promises to win back the lost ground.</p>\n<p>It soon became apparent this would not be possible and one UMNO insider later quipped that “Najib will simply have to improve on BN’s standing at the next election” to hold down his job.</p>\n<p>BN won 133 seats in the 222-seat Parliament down from 140 seats in 2008. Of the major coalition partners UMNO won 88 seats compared with 79 in 2008 thanks in part to gerrymandering, while the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was trounced picking up just seven seats, compared with 15 previously.</p>\n<p>In short, BN lost seven seats picked up by Anwar’s Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition for a total of 89 seats. Within PR the Democratic Action Party (DAP) picked-up the lion’s share of the Chinese vote adding 10 seats to the total while Anwar’s own party the Parti Keadilan Rakya (PKR) lost one seat and the Islamic firebrands at the Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS) dropped two seats.</p>\n<p>PR won 53.47 percent of the total vote.</p>\n<p>“UMNO and Malay nationalists were quick to blame the Chinese, openly accusing them of ingratitude and seeking to dominate the country,” Greenwood said.</p>\n<p>He added this was perhaps an ominous charge given it came less than a week ahead of the 44<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the 13 May 1969 race riots that resulted in the deaths of many hundreds of Chinese in Kuala Lumpur at the hands of well organised Malay mobs and the military.</p>\n<p>As Chinese voters gathered at the stadium they were no doubt mindful of this and another rally held in Kuala Lumpur almost two years ago calling for electoral reform, when police tear-gassed protestors who had found some respite on the grounds outside the Chinese maternity hospital.</p>\n<p>The gas was overwhelming, leaking into wards and a neighboring hospital as well. Police and the government denied the incident despite ample evidence from an international press corps and thousands of witnesses armed with cell phone cameras. Relations between the government and the Chinese community have never been quite the same.</p>\n<p>Anwar is refusing to concede defeat and is challenging the results of 30 seats but his days do appear to be numbered after he said during the lead-up to last weekend’s elections that he would stand down if he fails to win the top job.</p>\n<p>“If we don’t get the mandate, then we should give space for the second-liners in leadership,” he said during an online forum broadcast on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Anwar, 65, served as UMNO’s deputy prime minister until 1998 when he had a falling out with the then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad and was imprisoned for corruption and sodomy. He was released from jail in 2004, however, after the sodomy conviction was overturned and he quickly returned to Parliament.</p>\n<p>Despite retiring in 2003 after 22 years-in-power, Mahathir has remained Anwar’s nemesis. This rivalry is partly fueled by Mahathir’s son, Murhkriz, entering politics. He was a cabinet minister in the previous government and in this poll moved to state politics.</p>\n<p>Mahathir is widely believed to be steering his son towards the prime minister’s job and he could pose a threat to Muhyiddin’s ambitions. Mahathir said BN would now have to decide Najib’s fate after he presided over the coalition’s worst ever electoral performance.</p>\n<p>“I had hoped that this time BN would get more seats than in 2008 &#8230; I’m quite disappointed and shocked to find out that in the end BN got less than in 2008,” Mahathir told reporters while arguing that ungrateful Chinese and greedy Malays were behind the poor result.</p>\n<p>BN strategists have limited political prospects. Muhyiddin is strong on Malay nationalism which is unlikely to win him any friends among the Chinese while Khairy Jamaluddin, the President of the UMNO youth wing is also possibility. However Mahathir’s persistent interference long after he retired remains an issue and insiders say he has alienated voters, in particular traditional UMNO supporters keen on change and tired of a party which seems bent on repeating the sins of the past.</p>\n<p>Anwar was again acquitted of sodomy charges in January 2012 amid claims that UMNO’s old guard were using the legal system to carry out a campaign to smear and silence the country’s loudest and most popular opposition voice.</p>\n<p>Sodomy is illegal in the country and if convicted Anwar could have faced up to 20 years in prison. After being acquitted on that charge, Anwar was again arrested in May for taking part in an illegal rally that was attended by tens of thousands of people who demanded electoral reforms. He might have to be content with walking away after winning the popular vote.</p>\n<p>Among those most likely to take up Anwar’s mantle is his daughter, Nurul Izzah Anwar, who remains popular in her own right and is a PKR vice president.

Its technology that deserves to be considered by Cambodia, Malaysia, The Philippines and Brunei but some like East Timor are not keen.</p>\n<p>Built on barges, the floating pontoon is bigger than an aircraft carrier and capable of refining oil and freezing liquefied natural gas (LNG) at below minus 162 degrees celsius needed for export. Shell is constructing the world’s first for use at its operations at the Prelude/Concerto field in Australia’s North West Shelf. Other contractors are also coming on board.</p>\n<p>Escalating costs have forced Woodside Petroleum to abandoned $100 billion worth of projects including plans to build a $50 billion LNG export facility near Broome while BHP Billiton has cancelled two plans worth a combined $50 billion at Olympic Dam in South Australia and Port Hedland in West Australia.</p>\n<p>Woodisde is now considering its floating LNG (FLNG) options. Another FLNG operation is being planned by Inpex Corp for development of its Abadi field in Indonesia’s Arafura Sea. Its geographical make-up is similar to the Greater Sunrise field in East Timor where Woodside has to overcome the enormous depths of the Timor Trough.</p>\n<p>Woodside also wants FLNG deployed here but East Timorese officials have baulked and remain keen on constructing traditional onshore operations and providing well trained jobs for its population. It’s an argument that would win some sympathy in Phnom Penh but the Cambodian government has to date failed to develop any of the infrastructure required to access its touted oil reserves in the Gulf of Siam.</p>\n<p>FLNG technology would speed up that process. For companies, the potential financial benefits of FLNG far outweigh the initial outlays. FLNG also substantially lowers lead times, pose much less of an environmental risk or impose upon indigenous people living ashore.</p>\n<p>“This is likely to position floating LNG well as the market becomes increasingly competitive and could ultimately crowd out some conventional developments,” a Macquarie Research paper on the Australian energy sector noted.</p>\n<p>But it’s not the type of development wanted where politicians have promised an El Dorado of downstream industries would prosper off the back of the offshore ventures. This has put East Timor and its future earnings on an edge.</p>\n<p>Last week Dili alleged Australia had engaged in espionage and did not act in good faith during 2004 negotiations on a treaty for Sunrise’s development. It was the latest twist in efforts to have the royalty sharing treaty between Australia and East Timor invalidated. Dili wants fresh arbitration but Australia insists the treaty still stands.</p>\n<p>That, plus differences over the use of FLNG and the advent of fracking – where liquid is pumped into wells forcing the release of gas from difficult to get to areas – is making East Timor a less desirable destination for the oil and gas industry. Cambodia and other countries from around the region which have pinned their hopes to developing an oil and gas industry are no doubt watching this closely.</p>\n<p>&lt;ENDS&gt;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>By Luke Hunt AsiaWATCH &#8212; A push towards using massive offshore refining pontoons for processing crude oil and LNG is gaining momentum and forcing governments, including Cambodia, to rethink their growth strategies after pinning their <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/east-timor-floats-cambodias-lng-options/\" title=\"East Timor Floats Cambodia’s LNG Options\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2013-05-17 12:19:52',8,2,12,'2013-05-17 12:19:52','2013-05-17 12:25:14'),(3482,3482,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Flickr-usembassyjakarta-1-400x266.jpg','ASEAN Urges a Youthful Lead','asean-urges-a-youthful-lead','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Concern in Southeast Asia about the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015 is mounting.

Burning off by major palm oil companies in nearby Indonesia had reached such levels that the entire region was blanketed by smog.</p>\n<p>A petulant Mahathir also yelled at foreign correspondents covering the story alleging a grand conspiracy to blacken Malaysia’s name and undermine its tourism industry. Not quite.</p>\n<p>A few years later a Malaysian minister famously snapped at critics of the government’s burgeoning love affair with palm oil plantations &#8212; and the scorched earth policy required to grow them. “What do you want?” He asked, “monkeys or gold?”</p>\n<p>Ever since companies like Sime Darby and the Malaysian government have attempted to convince the world that Malaysian palm oil and rubber estates actually qualify as forests and are therefore entitled to financial compensation under international schemes designed to protect the environment – among them Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation or REDD.</p>\n<p>It’s an absurd claim – and one that Indonesia has indicated it would like to follow – however, it is also an accurate reflection of a regional political and corporate culture that has caused tens-of-millions of people to choke on an environmental mess, clockwork-like, every year.</p>\n<p>Southeast Asia has 24 million hectares of peat. More than 70 percent, or 20 million hectares, of this is in Indonesia, particularly in Sumatra, Borneo and West Papua and can reach up to 20 metres in depth. Peat fires can burn for months and continue burning underground long after the surface blaze has been extinguished by heavy annual rains.</p>\n<p>Their contribution to global warming cannot be underestimated and the worst of those fires was back in 1997-98 when as much 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon may have been released into the atmosphere. Historically it was an extraordinary amount and is widely believed to be behind an acceleration in the increase of global carbon dioxide levels ever since.</p>\n<p>Total costs incurred by medical institutions and through disruptions to travel and business was put at up to US$9 billion. Scientists have forecast that at the current burning off rate peat deposits could be wiped out by 2040. However, those realities continue to fall on deaf ears.</p>\n<p>The prevailing attitude was borne home by Agung Laksono, the Indonesian minister responsible for coordinating a response to the current Haze enveloping a large swathe of Southeast Asia. He effectively accused Singaporeans of behaving like cry babies over the latest smog and told his country’s critics to “shut-up and grow a pair” adding: “This is not what the Indonesian nation wants it is because of nature.”</p>\n<p>That was just further nonsense and an embarrassed President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono went on the offensive, appearing almost contrite on television while accepting responsibility for the latest disaster caused by the unbridled burning off of forests in Sumatra.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As president of Indonesia, I apologise for what has happened and ask for the understanding of the people of Malaysia and Singapore,&#8221; Yudhoyono said. He also asked that people not apportion blame until investigations were complete.</p>\n<p>The problem is that scientists and the authorities have known for 16 years who is responsible for the fires and where they occur. Malaysian and Singaporean companies are as much to blame as their Indonesian counterparts and their governments who tax them and the wealth funds that invest in them.</p>\n<p>Indonesia&#8217;s Senior Presidential Aide Kuntoro Mangkusubroto named Asia Pacific Resources International, Asia Pulp and Paper and Sime Darby, as being involved with the current burning of Sumatra.</p>\n<p>Also cited were subsidiaries operated by Singapore listed but Indonesian controlled Sinar Mas and Raja Garuda Mas, along with Kepong Berhad and Wilmar International of Singapore which claim to operate strict no-burning policies.</p>\n<p>As usual the companies are blaming small land holders for the fires while Singapore and Malaysia are promising to scour their corporate records in search of violators and are promising to raise the issue at next week’s foreign ministers meeting for the Association Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Brunei.</p>\n<p>That meeting will achieve little. Raising the Haze in an ASEAN forum is about as common as the acrid smoke which ruins the air people breathe. An Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution – widely criticized as a toothless tiger – was reached in 2003 but Indonesia still refuses to ratify it.</p>\n<p>The inability to tackle the Haze effectively and stem the annihilation of the region’s natural environment by successive governments and their boardroom allies smacks of negligence and opens the companies to potential law suits and compensation claims.</p>\n<p>Asthmatics, people with heart conditions, senior citizens, there are no shortages of groups who have been disadvantaged. Children in some parts cannot go to school, flights have been cancelled and this year’s Haze is shaping up to be as bad as the devastating smog of 1997.</p>\n<p>A case could be made in Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the United Nations. The latter could possibly be fought in the International Criminal Court as a human rights issue &#8212; the right to breathe clean air.</p>\n<p>Compensation packages and costly legal battles will punish the bottom line of the companies involved and inevitable hurt their stock price, however, this might prove far more effective in combating the Haze than the annual bouts of empty rhetoric and political paper shuffling that reoccur every 12-months.</p>\n<p><em>Luke Hunt can be followed on Twitter at </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeanthonyhunt\">@lukeanthonyhunt</a><em>.</em></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article first appeared in The Edge Review.

Almost four decades after the Khmer Rouge marched Into Phnom Penh the work of journalists and photographers from that tragic era is finally being laid bare before a war crimes tribunal which prosecutors hope will put away Pol Pot’s remaining henchmen.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the scope of their evidence and who can testify is limited by the court’s mandate which is consigned to judging crimes and hearing evidence from events that occurred strictly under the Khmer Rouge rule, from April 17, 1975 to January 9, 1979.</p>\n<p>Among the most prominent was the <i>New York Times</i> correspondent Sydney Schanberg who spoke of the forced evacuations ordered after the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh and how one Khmer woman begged him to take her baby away.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it’,” Schanberg said. “At that point, a French woman said, ‘I’ll do it, and I know all these people in relief organizations, and I’ll make sure he finds a family.’”</p>\n<p>The baby was handed over by its weeping mother.</p>\n<p>Schanberg told the court that food shortages emerged with the Khmer Rouge annexation of the country while defence lawyers for former Brother Number Two Nuon Chea and former head of state Khieu Samphan noted Schanberg had been criticized for holding too much of an American view.</p>\n<p>“Some might call it an imperialist view,” said Nuon Chea’s lawyer Victor Koppe.</p>\n<p>With Schanberg was the American photojournalist Al Rockoff who gave a poignant testimony, much of it in regards to the work of another photographer, Frenchman Roland Neveau.</p>\n<p>As a former US Army photographer, Rockoff was also the first US military veteran who served in Indochina during what he refers to as the “American War” to testify before the court.</p>\n<p>“A cadre with a bullhorn was saying: ‘The war is over. The war is over.’ Everything was OK at that point. They weren’t panicking, they were happy, the soldiers, the civilians,” he told the court.</p>\n<p>But then the order to evacuate came. Pol Pot wanted the people of Phnom Penh out of the city immediately and Rockoff added: “About an hour later, the mood changed.”</p>\n<p>Rockoff, Schanberg and Neveau were with the Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran and British journalist John Swain of the <i>Sunday Times</i> who stayed behind after April 17, finding shelter in the French Embassy.</p>\n<p>Rockoff, 64, told the court how thousands of people, desperate for refuge, were wandering the city, how a swimming pool in a five-star hotel was turned into a giant septic tank, which he described as gross, and how patients were marched out of hospital wards, leaving bloodied floors behind them.</p>\n<p>After scouting the city on an assignment, Rockoff and Schanberg encountered Khmer Rouge soldiers, some quite young, and were forced into an armored personnel carrier where they tried to pass themselves off as French.</p>\n<p>“Sydney got very upset when I started speaking English in the APC, and he said, ‘Don’t speak English. You’re French,’” Rockoff said. Their bags were then searched.</p>\n<p>“One Khmer Rouge held up a big wad of hundred dollar bills in one hand and Sydney’s underwear in the other. He put the money back in the blue hand bag and kept the underwear,” Rockoff said. “I guess the money had no value at that time to him.”</p>\n<p>Schanberg, who testified via Skype, left no doubt about what happened in the first day of Khmer Rouge rule.</p>\n<p>“Almost the entire population of almost two million were taken out of the city on that first day,” he said</p>\n<p>“We saw people being pushed on beds . . . with bottles of serum hanging from the bed. They were all being forced out of the city. And the avenue that we came out on was scattered with the shoes and sandals that people had lost as they were forced to walk quickly in those huge crowds.”</p>\n<p>The Khmer Rouge were swept from power by invading Vietnamese forces in late 1978. Hanoi’s occupation continued until the Cold War ended a decade later. Civil conflict continued until 1998 and it was only then that any form tribunal could only be considered.</p>\n<p>The Khmer Rouge Tribunal, known locally as the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC), has endured mixed fortunes since case 001 was launched with the indictment of the death camp commander Kaing Guek Eav, also known as Duch, who was eventually jailed for life.</p>\n<p>A chronic lack of funds amid allegations of nepotism and cronyism among the Khmer staff and an uneasy relationship with Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has indicated he does not want to see the tribunal expanded, have also cast a shadow over proceedings.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the ECCC has shed some light on one of the darkest chapters of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n<p>Former BBC journalist and author Philip Short offered a rare glimpse into Chinese thought at the time. China was the only country to have backed the Khmer Rouge after Pol Pot fell out of favour with the Vietnamese and the rest of the Communist world.</p>\n<p>Short, who wrote biographies of Pol Pot and Chinese leader Mao Zedong, said the decision to evacuate and put people into labour camps – which would result in the deaths of about two million people over the next three years-and-a-half years &#8212; had worried the Chinese Communist Party.</p>\n<p>“I think Lenin would have said it was an infantile form of communism. It was very extreme,” he said. “In China, they stopped [killing] and instituted thought reform. Mao said, ‘Heads are not like chives; they don’t grow back again if you cut them off.’ Well, in Cambodia, they cut them off.”</p>\n<p>Short later added the make-up of the regime had prevented Pol Pot and his henchmen from heeding China’s urging for restraint. It was an important point. Beijing has always declined to comment on its support for the maniacal regime and Short’s comments added some much needed political perspective to the era and relations between Kampuchea and China.</p>\n<p>“Zhou Enlai was worried about what was going to happen in Cambodia, and warned Khieu Samphan to avoid imitating the Great Leap Forward . . . and argued in favour of moderation – unsuccessfully, of course,” he said. “Mao was impressed by what the Khmer Rouge had done, but he too was worried.”</p>\n<p>Another former <i>New York Times</i> journalist and author Elizabeth Becker, has been called to testify but her appearance has also been constantly delayed amid legal wrangles. Her book <i>When the War was Over</i> is being used by prosecutors as basic background material at the tribunal.</p>\n<p>“It turns out I was in the unusual category of being both an expert witness (there are about eight of us) and a fact witness,” she said.</p>\n<p>However, her initial reaction to testifying was mixed.</p>\n<p>“As an American journalist I immediately thought &#8216;no, I can&#8217;t testify.&#8217; I didn&#8217;t want to do anything that might compromise journalistic freedoms protected under the Constitution.</p>\n<p>“But after consultation with a lawyer I realized that was not the case. I had retired from the <i>New York Times</i> so I was no longer a member of the press with responsibilities as a daily journalist. I had donated most of my papers and copies of my photographs of the Khmer Rouge to my alma mater the University of Washington and its Southeast Asia Library special collections.</p>\n<p>“Everything was in the public record. So I was not breaking any confidentiality. With those assurances, I accepted the invitation,” she said.</p>\n<p>In 1978 Becker was one of three people who went to Democratic Kampuchea, allowed in under the tight control of the Khmer Rouge. On their last night, Khmer Rouge gunmen attacked and killed Malcolm Caldwell, an academic, which was one reason behind her decision to testify.</p>\n<p>“In today&#8217;s wars journalists are being targeted to keep them away,” Becker said.</p>\n<p>“Look at Syria. The government does not want witnesses to the warfare and atrocities, especially not journalists who create permanent records and spread the news immediately. If journalists testifying at trials increase the likelihood of more targeting of journalists, that is a problem.</p>\n<p>“I thought long and hard about that issue. In the end, I decided to testify because I was a witness to just that sort of targeting,” she said referring to Caldwell’s death.</p>\n<p><em>Parts of this article have appeared in The Edge Review.</em></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>By Luke Hunt ASIAWATCH &#8212; Almost four decades after the Khmer Rouge marched Into Phnom Penh the work of journalists and photographers from that tragic era is finally being laid bare before a war crimes <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/trial-by-media-in-pol-pots-dock/\" title=\"Trial by Media in Pol Pot’s Dock\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2013-07-18 08:42:42',8,2,12,'2013-07-18 08:42:42','2013-07-18 08:42:42'),(3676,3676,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/download-8.jpg','Nguyen Van Hai: Vietnamese Hunger Striker “Very Weak”','nguyen-van-hai-vietnamese-hunger-striker-very-weak','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Nguyen Van Hai – a Vietnamese blogger and a founding member of the Free Journalists Club – is reportedly in a very weak state after his hunger strike entered its 30th day.

Three journalists were murdered within 48 hours of each other in the start of August prompting a chorus of international outrage by media watchdogs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Time and again, Philippine journalists are killed, circumstances remain a mystery, and the killers go unpunished,” Shawn Crispin, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) senior Southeast Asia representative, said. &#8220;Until President Benigno Aquino&#8217;s government takes serious action to address his country&#8217;s impunity problem, the killings of journalists will continue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Killed were photographer Mario Sy, shot dead in front of his wife and daughter, at home in the city of General Santos. Bonifacio Loreto Jr, former publisher of the Aksyon Ngayon newspaper, and its former executive editor, Richard Kho, were gunned down in Quezon City.</p>\n<p>Loreto and Kho had reputations for being critical of politicians in columns published by Aksyon Ngayon before folding earlier this year.</p>\n<p>The New York-based CPJ says at least 73 Philippine journalists have been killed in direct connection to their work since 1992, making it the second deadliest country in the world for the press.</p>\n<p>Further deaths were reported from South America and Central Asia while Reporters Without Borders said it condemned in the possible strongest terms the murder in Benghazi of Azzedine Kousad, a Satellite TV presenter with al-Hurra. It said three gunmen opened fire on his car, killing him witth six shots, before fleeing.</p>\n<p>The 25-year-old journalist was also a qualified doctor and respected sheikh in the east of Libya. He was reported to have received a telephone call threatening his life if he delivered a speech celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of Ramadan. He was shot dead a day after he gave the speech.</p>\n<p>In Australia, the media landscape received mixed blessings. In Perth the West Australian Supreme Court found in favor of West Australian Newspapers (WAN) and journalist Steven Pennells who was facing a potential two years behind bars after upsetting that country’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart.</p>\n<p>The billionaire mining magnate has engaged in a bitter feud with two of her children over a family trust account and was demanding that Pennells and his paper handover the names of sources who had contributed to his stories. The court found Pennells and WAN had every right to protect their sources.</p>\n<p>While the Supreme Court Judges had journalist raising their glasses the same could not be said at Murdoch papers on Australia’s east coast where the senior executive and much maligned Col Allan has made a return to run the News Corp ‘sagenda amid looming elections.</p>\n<p>Sometimes dubbed Col Pot – after the Khmer Rouge dictator – for his harsh style of management, one scribe praised him as “News Corp’s most feared flamethrower in a company of flamethrowers”. His arrival was immediately followed by the resignation of News Corp’s Australia chief Kim Williams.</p>\n<p>While journalists and senior executives might dread Allan’s arrival, his main target remains Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party’s roll-out of the National Broadband Network which is seen as a threat to Murdoch’s pay TV monopoly, Foxtel.</p>\n<p>Courts in Singapore have also been busy with common sense prevailing after charges against a political cartoonist were dropped in return for an apology. According to the city-state’s attorney-general Chew Peng Ee, known as &#8220;Demon-cratic Singapore&#8221;, had committed contempt &#8220;by scandalizing the judiciary of the Republic of Singapore&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Singapore has reputation for being thinned-skinned when criticized and Chew was facing possible jail time over four cartoons published in 2011 and 2012 over perceived injustices by the courts. Critics welcomed the decision saying it could be a sign of increasing tolerance of political opponents.</p>\n<p>Such tolerance has rarely been visible in China where a prominent journalist says he was kidnapped by state authorities during another harsh crackdown. Chen Min says he was snatched in Beijing and forcibly returned to Guangdong Province after calling for the release of human rights activist Xu Zhiyong.</p>\n<p>Min says he was kept under guard for 48 hours and has since called on the Chinese government allow its people “to truly enjoy freedom from terror” adding that state suppression was impossible to tolerate.</p>\n<p>Similar arguments have been mooted against the United States in defense Edward Snowden, the latest whistleblower to provide the White House with a diplomatic headache which the Russians were happy to prolong by grant the former CIA contractor asylum after his extended stopover in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>According to journalist Glen Grunwald from the Guardian newspaper, another 20,000 documents have been received from Snowden whose leaks about the US surveillance programs has dominated headlines and nations which once believed they were not targets of spying by Washington.</p>\n<p>Existence of those documents was made known during a hearing by the Brazilian Senate’s Foreign Affairs Committee tasked with examining American surveillance of their country.</p>\n<p>In Thailand a journalist has been harassed and questioned in connection with comments he posted on his personal Facebook page speculating about a possible military coup. The CPJ said it had called on Thai authorities to drop the criminal investigation against Sermsuk Kasitpradit and to refrain broadly from curbing freedom of expression over the Internet.</p>\n<p>Finally in a sad farewell, Yehuda Lev, World War II veteran and widely regarded as an iconoclastic journalist has died. A hero too many, Lev was also a veteran Israel’s War of Independence after he established a European underground route to smuggle Holocaust survivors to Palestine. He died after a prolonged illness.

With neighbours like the Soviet Union and its recalcitrant regional satellites, Syria, Iraq and Iran, keeping the peace was the mantra underpinning Turkey’s projection of soft power within the politics of the region.</p>\n<p>It was a common sense policy that earned Ankara a wealth of respect across the Middle East and beyond – until very recently. A combination of nasty domestic differences, unfettered access to oil and gas and a leader’s uncompromising ego is heralding an end to a once peaceful approach.</p>\n<p>At the center of this policy shift is Turkey’s Prime Minister TayyipErdogan, whose formidable abilities have achieved what many once thought almost impossible. Since coming to power in 2003, he has rehabilitated a dilapidated Istanbul, brought the country’s finances under control and delivered Turkey a realistic chance of membership in the European Union.</p>\n<p>But those accomplishments of a personality forged out of an impoverished upbringing and Islamic values have more recently been overshadowed by Erdogan’soutright belligerence, and he is thrusting his agenda onto a war-weary world.</p>\n<p>Local headlines like: “Turkey Calls on World to ‘Walk the Walk’ in Syria” and “Turkey would join International coalition against, says Foreign Minister” are troublesome, presumptuous and smack of a desire to internationalize a tragic conflict that has already claimed some 100,000 lives.</p>\n<p>“To say that Erdogan is an aggressive character is an understatement,” said one longtime observer who declined to be named, adding that the treatment of people who speak their mind about the government in Turkey was comparable to the way China treats its dissidents.</p>\n<p>Syria, meanwhile, is descending into a greater and greater mess. There are more than one million Syrian refugees on Turkish soil from where the Free Syrian Army (FSA) has been allowed to operate. The situation has been made much worse by further allegations that the embattled government of Bashar al-Assad was using chemical weapons on their own people in the country’s two-and-a-half-year civil war.</p>\n<p>Turkish Foreign Minister AhmetDavutoglu has been doing the rounds and urging military action against Syria, regardless of United Nations conventions or any decisions by the U.N. Security Council, after up to 1,000 people were allegedly killed by chemical weapons, possibly sarin gas, fired by government forces into a Damascus suburb controlled by rebels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We always prioritize acting together with the international community, with <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/subjects/united-nations?lc=int_mb_1001\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a> decisions. If such a decision doesn&#8217;t emerge from the U.N. Security Council, other alternatives &#8230; would come onto the agenda,&#8221; Davutoglu said recently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently 36-37 countries are discussing these alternatives. If a coalition is formed against <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/places/syria?lc=int_mb_1001\" target=\"_blank\">Syria</a> in this process, <a title=\"Full coverage of Turkey\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/places/turkey\" target=\"_blank\">Turkey</a> would take its place in this coalition.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Washington is now convinced sufficient proof exists that chemical weapons were used by the Syrian government,and international clamor for a military response is growing louder, muffling out warnings from Russia that it will act to protect what its deems as its sphere of influence.</p>\n<p>Undeterred by Moscow’s threats, Erdogan has pushed even further. He wants military intervention and for the Syrian leadership to be put on trial for crimes against humanity. He said if the U.N. cannot agree on what should be done, he has mooted suggestions from his political corner that an alternative to the U.N. should be established.</p>\n<p>The Turkish opposition, however, is opposed to military intervention and Erdogan’s reasoning has been sharply criticized.</p>\n<p>With elections due next year, analysts say he fears the bloody protests which erupted in Taksim Square in July will escalate and claim his political scalp in a Turkish re-run of demonstrations that toppled governments in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt.</p>\n<p>It’s what the prominent Turkish columnist Murat Yetkin referred to as the “What if it happens here too” factor.</p>\n<p>“The other thing to consider is the Kurdish issue. That’s always been the conflict that’s consumed a lot of their focus,” the long-term observer said. “Erdogan has done a great job of resolving the differences with the Kurds &#8212; without upsetting Turkish sensibilities, which is a hard thing to do.”</p>\n<p>Resolving the long-running Kurdish dispute was perhaps Erdogan’s greatest victory. The Kurds have renounced violence and prospered after Ankara recognized the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) rule over northern Iraq. Deals were done and Turkey now relies almost entirely on the KRG for its oil and gas supplies.</p>\n<p>As a prominent member of NATO, Turkey’s voice has weight. However, this is often undone by old-fashioned hatreds. With the Kurdish issue under control,Erdogan has turned his attention to Egypt, where a military coup ousted President Mohamed Morsi two months ago.</p>\n<p>Despite democratic elections that brought Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood, a hardline Islamic group, to power a little over a year ago, Morsi’s leadership looked increasingly like it was pulling the country in a conservative Islamist direction that was unwanted by the Egyptian military, Western governments, Israel and secular Egyptians. Massive protests against Morsi ultimately culminated in the military coup that ousted him two months ago.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Brotherhood has a friend in Erdogan, who blames Israel for the coup against Morsi. It was a silly statement that prompted an international rebuke. International commentator Jeffrey Goldberg described Erdogan as a “smart man with Jews on the brain” and as a “semi-unhinged bigot.”</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of anti-Semitism among political leaders in the Middle East, including pro-Western leaders with a local agenda. U.S.-led missile strikes on Syria in response to the use of chemical weapons now seem inevitable, but “walking the walk” with Turkey on a military adventure across its border would only make an already untenable and tragic situation far worse.</p>\n<p><i>Luke Hunt can be followed on Twitter at @lukeanthonyhunt</i></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article first appeared in The Edge Review By LUKE HUNT / Istanbul Throughout the Cold War, Turkey played a deft diplomatic hand.

Obviously, it would also provide the authorities with evidence for legal action and prosecutions.</p>\n<p>However, sources within ASEAN say Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta have conspired to keep this information out of the public domain, agreeing only to share it among themselves and between the relevant ministries.</p>\n<p>One source said this was now the main sticking point, with big Malaysian businesses again receiving favorable treatment from Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur at the expense of millions in the region who are forced to live with the choking smog.</p>\n<p>“Singapore has said this does fall short of what it&#8217;s been trying to achieve,” he said, adding that Le Luong Minh, the new ASEAN secretary general from Vietnam, is also angered by the deal.</p>\n<p>Management of the smog by ASEAN dates back to 1997, when then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad banned journalists from covering the phenomenon when it first emerged and alleged an international conspiracy designed to tarnish the image of his country and its tourism industry.</p>\n<p>The Malaysian government also tried to convince the world its monoculture palm oil and rubber plantations should be put on equal footing with forests, because they are trees. Therefore, it would be entitled to financial compensation under international climate change schemes like the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD.</p>\n<p>Such spin doctoring helped deflect criticism of regional governments, local companies and palm oil producing groups responsible for the widespread annual burning-off, while shifting the blame onto traditional small-scale farmers who still practice slash and burn agricultural techniques.</p>\n<p>In Southeast Asia, there are an estimated 24 million hectares of peat, 70 per cent of which is in Indonesia, mostly in Sumatra, Borneo and West Papua. The deposits can reach depths of up to 20 metres, and when set alight, will burn for months. Because of their depth, peat can continue to burn underground long after heavy rains have extinguished the surface blaze.</p>\n<p>In 1997, about 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon is believed to have been released into the atmosphere – enough, according to climate scientists, to accelerate the increase of global carbon dioxide levels. Subsequent costs caused by the smoke neared US$9 billion.</p>\n<p>Despite the damage, Jakarta’s has not been willing to sign off on the trans-boundary ASEAN treaty, initially drawn up in 2002 with the approval of all other ASEAN members, to provide a regional response to the fires.</p>\n<p>Environmentalists say Jakarta is doing big business a favor, but when the latest haze began to spread in June, Indonesia seemed ready to relent and political deals were done. That was until bureaucrats began pointing their fingers at the latest cozy relationship between Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>\n<p>Sources said self interest had resulted in the latest back-pedaling on pronouncements made at an ASEAN environment ministers meeting in Bali last year, when the sharing of geo-digital information was put forward and tacit agreements reached.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Greater transparency is required to make plantation companies and land owners responsible for the haze, more accountable, and employing best management practices in land clearing activities as well as to undertake concerted effort in fire suppression,&#8221; ASEAN said in a statement at the time.</p>\n<p>It was also agreed to &#8220;undertake more deterrent and effective enforcement measures against offenders,&#8221; but one bureaucrat has since described politicking over the haze as “ping pong between ministries,” while ASEAN sources said Minh argued that monitoring needed to be authoritative in order to act as a &#8220;strong deterrent against irresponsible behavior.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As result of the efforts by Malaysian and Indonesian authorities to stop information from digital-geo-referenced maps from entering the public domain, the Haze Monitoring System due to be signed off by ASEAN next month now appears unlikely, because Indonesia won’t ratify the ASEAN haze trans-boundary treaty.</p>\n<p>At the current burning-off rate, scientists have forecast that peat deposits, a necessity for the sustainability of rainforests, could be wiped out by 2040. ASEAN’s inability to deal with this issue is providing the group with yet another unwanted litmus test of its ability to function as a real and effective political bloc.</p>\n<p><i>Luke Hunt can be followed on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeanthonyhunt\" target=\"_blank\">@lukeanthonyhunt</a></i></p>\n<p>END</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article first appeared in The Edge Review By LUKE HUNT / Kuala Lumpur Expectations that Southeast Asian governments would find a united and workable approach to dealing with the dreaded haze that annually blankets <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/malaysia-indonesia-seen-as-spoilers-in-asean-anti-haze-deal/\" title=\"Malaysia, Indonesia seen as spoilers in ASEAN anti-haze deal\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2013-09-29 13:45:25',8,2,12,'2013-09-29 13:45:25','2013-09-29 13:45:25'),(3892,3892,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/download-6.jpg','The Philippines: Counting the Costs in Zamboanga','the-philippines-counting-the-costs-in-zamboanga','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; In the Philippines, authorities are counting the costs of the damage inflicted by the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) following its pointless raid on Zamboanga in the country’s troubled south and the lengths to which the emergency services had to go, to protect the innocent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/asean-beat/2013/09/28/the-philippines-counting-the-costs-in-zamboanga/\" target=\"_blank\">Read more from Luke Hunt in <em>The Diplomat</em>.</a></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; In the Philippines, authorities are counting the costs of the damage inflicted by the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) following its pointless raid on Zamboanga in the country’s troubled south and <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/the-philippines-counting-the-costs-in-zamboanga/\" title=\"The Philippines: Counting the Costs in Zamboanga\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2013-09-30 09:28:21',8,2,10,'2013-09-30 09:28:21','2013-09-30 09:28:21'),(3896,3896,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Afghanistan-0007LH.jpg','Malaysian PM Najib Razak Warns of the Battle for Islam','malaysian-pm-najib-razak-warns-of-the-battle-for-islam','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has had a difficult time since narrowly winning controversial elections in May.

Mobs were rampaging through the streets. Foreign and Afghan troops, fearing the capital was under attack, reached for their guns as civilians scampered for cover. It was September 11, the 12th anniversary of the al-Qaeda strikes on New York, Washington D.C. and Pennsylvania, and across Afghanistan security was tight and tensions high.</p>\n<p>The mood quickly brightened when troops realized their reaction was misguided. While bombings and firefights were being reported from the countryside, Kabul was not under attack – it was a false alarm. Afghanistan had just defeated old rivals India 2-0, winning the South Asia Football Federation Championship.</p>\n<p>Such a victory was unprecedented and impossible when the Taliban ruled here.

Taliban attacks are continuing amid reports the Islamic militia is recruiting heavily among the ethnic Pashtu and regrouping inside Pakistan’s borders for an all-out offensive once the pullout is completed.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the country’s harried bureaucracy is struggling with preparations for presidential elections that are widely expected to be held in early April when President Hamid Karzai will stand down, having completed his mandated two terms.</p>\n<p>He says he’d prefer to see a small number of candidates standing as opposed to the mess created by the 40-odd politicians who stood for president in 2009.</p>\n<p>Abdullah Abdullah, a close runner-up four years ago and Ashraf Ghani, a former finance minister, are among the early favourites. Both have broad appeal and are known quantities. Abdullah has the added advantage of having been a close friend of Ahmad Shah Masood, who led the Northern Alliance against Taliban occupation and was assassinated shortly before the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.</p>\n<p>But it’s the presence of Abdul Rasul Sayyaf &#8212; a controversial warlord and former regional commander whose links to al-Qaeda stretch from here to Africa and the Southern Philippines – that has raised eyebrows and perhaps best reflects the complexities of Afghanistan’s constantly shifting allegiances.</p>\n<p>Sayyaf’s strength, according to American-based Afghan author and academic Philip Smucker, is that he comes from a warlord base, a position of strength that Afghans find politically attractive.</p>\n<p>Other potential candidats already noted by Karzai include his own brother, Qayum Karzai, current Afghan ambassador to Pakistan Omar Daudzai and former interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalali.</p>\n<p>“There are alternative candidates, but their problem is they don’t come from a warlord base,” Smucker said. “These people are intellectuals and they don’t necessarily resonate with the broader population.”</p>\n<p>Sayyaf also trained Filipino militants in Africa who returned home and established the Abu Sayyaf, a group synonymous with banditry and kidnappings that is calling for an Islamic homeland in the Southern Philippines while battling U.S. troops there.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Gavin Greenwood, a regional security analyst with Hong Kong-based Allan &amp; Associates, said that if Sayyaf can deliver as president, then all previous affiliations would be forgiven and forgotten.</p>\n<p>“The American political class can probably deal with anyone who enables them to leave on the timeline and with a modicum of dignity, but not too sure where Fox News will go with this,” he said.</p>\n<p>And from that perspective, the biggest obstacles faced by ISAF are not from unpalatable potential leaders, but from the tribal elders who have backed the U.S.-led international coalition, which has dominated Afghanistan’s rugged terrain for almost 12 years.</p>\n<p>They have said the ability of insurgents to roam unchecked across the countryside would make it impossible to provide adequate security needed to hold legitimate elections.</p>\n<p>In the past week alone, car bombs and firefights outside the U.S. consulate in the western capital of Herat resulted in the deaths of two Afghans. A day later, a Pakistani general was killed and others wounded when a military convoy came under attack in the Taliban heartland near Kandahar. At least 64 Taliban were killed in separate firefights and a senior female police officer assassinated.</p>\n<p>People are now incapable of even registering to vote due to an overwhelming presence of insurgents, said Abdul Ghani Tokhi, an elder from the province of Zabul. He voiced his concerns as the country’s Independent Elections Commission began receiving applications from 2014 presidential candidates.</p>\n<p>American forces will be cut by half from a current 62,000 troops by early next year and the number of bases will be slashed from more than 100 to less than 10 once the withdrawal is complete. The ANA will be provided with basic backup, but combating the Taliban, al-Qeada and the numerous affiliated outfits will fall squarely on their shoulders.</p>\n<p>Their ability to defend Afghanistan’s social and political gains going forward will be difficult, and April elections will provide a real test of ANA capabilities, assuming that tribal elders are unsuccessful in their bid to have these elections postponed until 2018.</p>\n<p>But if all goes well, Afghanistan will have marked a significant turning point in its turbulent history and the authorities might be reaching for bells and whistles instead of AK47s when the country scores its next big win on the international sporting stage.</p>\n<p><em>Luke Hunt can be followed on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeanthonyhunt\" target=\"_blank\">@lukeanthonyhunt</a></em></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article first appeared in The Edge Review By LUKE HUNT / Kabul The sound of gunfire rang out across Kabul.

His name is a guarded secret and his job as a media advisor has included senior brass in the United States military, militants and jihadists.</p>\n<p>He knows his business and avoids industry cliché’s and buzz words while opting for a minimalist approach. His clients are not journalists nor are they media savvy. Nearly all are difficult, activists in some shape or form and his latest mission is no exception, it’s the Free Syrian Army (FSA).</p>\n<p>“It is about communications and messages,” he said after a brisk early morning walk. “There is no disagreement. There is a lack of clear leadership, hierarchy and structures within the FSA and that makes it all the more difficult.”</p>\n<p>We are sitting at a sidewalk café with the Bosporus below. Turkey is a safe-haven for FSA rebels, provided by the Turkish government and its pro-Islamic Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who would be happy to see the Syrian regime toppled.</p>\n<p>‘But first,” he says, while taking a deep breath, “there needs to be a simple change”.</p>\n<p>“The FSA have felt a lot of frustration that the world doesn’t seem to care very much. They now understand that one of the big problems in the Arab world, post 9/11, is the Muslim depiction of martyrdom – there should be no depiction of Syrian blood as the blood of martyrs,” he said.</p>\n<p>More than 100,000 people have died and two million refugees have abandoned their country after two-and-a-half years of civil war in Syria aimed at ousting the hard line President Bashar al-Assad and his Baath Party, which has ruled since 1970 when his father took control in the Corrective Revolution.</p>\n<p>The use of chemicals weapons, allegedly by Bashar and his military, has stirred outside sentiment but fears of spreading the conflict into Russia’s sphere of influence on top of more than 10-years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq has curtailed the stomach for another fight in the war-weary West.</p>\n<p>Much of this fatigue, the FSA’s media trainer says, stems from the propaganda emanating out of the Muslim world since the al-Qaeda strikes on New York and Washington in 2001.</p>\n<p>“Over the last decade of the 9/11 conflicts in the Muslim world people have also been prone to making outrageous statements and blowing themselves up. This is not required and the FSA need to portray itself as a positive force. There is a need to say that it is very reasonable to not like the Assad regime, it’s reasonable and there are some very good reasons to get rid of all of them,” he said.</p>\n<p>Almost 20 members communications wing of the FSA sit in on the course, normally run over two to three days. As their media mentor the American says it is difficult to gauge success</p>\n<p>“How much training does a fighter pilot need before he gets to fly a plane? How much training does a General need before he gets in front of a camera? Now, if you want to put a four-star General before a camera with no training – well, then good luck with that.”</p>\n<p>He said leaders and their militaries tend to fight their last wars – a criticism often leveled at the United Sates for using World War II battle techniques during the Vietnam War which cost them dearly.</p>\n<p>The last war in the Middle East, the Arab Spring, was between the state and the people but the similarities of the popular uprisings that brought down governments in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt have not automatically translated in Syria or in favor of the rebels.</p>\n<p>“Put a million people into a square, make a movie about it and put it on Youtube – well that was a pretty interesting new tactic, now it’s common and the Syrians have become very good at controlling that. The FSA needs a new approach, to get their message across deep inside Syria and beyond.”</p>\n<p>“I think it’s been hard. It’s the nature of the conflict. From the outside Syria mirrors the great battles of the past but it’s not like that at all,” he said referring to the destruction of Syrian cities.</p>\n<p>“If there is anything called the Arab Spring it started on the streets, it’s about the streets. Now Syria is different to Libya, Egypt and Tunisia. The FSA underestimated the strength of the regime. Iran and Russia didn’t have much to do with the Arab Spring but they have bought into this one,” he said.</p>\n<p>The biggest issue confronting the FSA is finding a recognizable face, a spokesman, someone in charge who Western audiences and their political leaders can relate too.</p>\n<p>“This war is going back to the streets. It’s street fighting being run block by block in every big city, like Aleppo. This limits the need for forward base and has destroyed these cities and towns, reduced them to rubble – and every block has its own leader acting unilaterally.”</p>\n<p>Until a genuine leadership emerges, capable of uniting the various forces – which includes militants linked to al-Qaeda who do not want Western military involvement – the message is: “The Syrians just want get rid of Assad and there are a lot of good reasons to support this.”</p>\n<p>With that said, the latest addition to the FSA finishes off his coffee, stands and wanders off towards a crowded Taksim Square – where thousands of protestors were injured and detained in July following another military crackdown. This time the demonstrators were opposed to an increasingly harsher rule by Erdogan and have promised to oust him. The barrel-chested American turns and offers one last quip: “My work here may not be done.”</p>\n<p><i>Luke Hunt can be followed on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeanthonyhunt\" target=\"_blank\">@lukeanthonyhunt</a></i></p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>By Luke Hunt in Istanbul AsiaWATCH &#8212;

Escalating costs, government crackdowns and a less than compliant cargo is making life difficult for the likes of Abu Saleh, Captain Bram, Abu Visam and Sayed Abbas – perhaps Asia’s most notorious illegal importers of human beings.</p>\n<p>All four have plied their trade from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka through the Middle East to Europe or via Southeast Asia and into Australia, making small fortunes out of illegal immigrants, political asylum seekers, economic refugees and ordinary people desperate for a peaceful life.</p>\n<p>Much of that business begins here around the jewelry shops of Chicken Street in Kabul, where the desperate swap family heirlooms for cash, and negotiate with travel agents who pass themselves off as legitimate businessmen while acting as middlemen for smugglers.</p>\n<p>The going rate for forged passports and visas, tickets into Southeast Asia or the Middle East, and boats to Australia or Europe is currently fetching up to US$25,000 a head. That’s up from between US$10,000 to US$12,000 in the late 1990s.</p>\n<p>International authorities says Captain Bram, a long-term operator based out of Indonesia, has notched-up 40 individual smuggling attempts into Australia since 2008, the Indonesian government was aware of this but has refused Australian requests for an extradition.</p>\n<p>Australian government sources blame Saleh for an operation that went tragically wrong, ending in the deaths of at least 31 passengers in Indonesian waters two months ago.</p>\n<p>Reports of bullying by the crew are also common and according to one non-governmental organization (NGO) source “&#8230; smugglers will extort sexual favors from women by threatening not to send them to Australia if they do not comply.”</p>\n<p>In another incident crewmen bet on who could make one passenger cry first. The winner claimed his prize after the hapless Afghan was dumped and deserted on a remote beach. Most crimes, however, go unreported and are more often linked to blackmail and extortion and that occur en-route.</p>\n<p>Typically, people smugglers also ply the scheduled airline routes, ferrying Afghans, Iraqis and Iranian to Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Kuala Lumpur as readily as they do across the Indian Ocean, Malaccan Straits or Timor Sea.</p>\n<p>In Southeast Asia smugglers have long-favored Chow Kit, a suburb in Kula Lumpur, to transit their cargo through. Here friendly hotels, restaurants and nearby mosques offer shelter with few questions asked while the money is collected and paperwork finalized ahead their next journey to Indonesia.</p>\n<p>From small, secluded fishing ports in Java and Sumatra, the final leg to Australia is made. But too often the voyage is marred by trouble and case files provided by Australian government sources offer a rare insight into the plight of what it calls illegal immigrants.</p>\n<p>One asylum seeker banked US$15,000 after seven years of restaurant work. The sum was used as a down payment for passage for his family from Afghanistan to Australia but they were arrested in Indonesia where they remain stranded with the smugglers refusing to pay back their money.</p>\n<p>In another incident, smugglers were disbelieving when one client claimed his fare was paid. He was threatened with a syringe filled with a yellow liquid and told to hand over his passport. The passport was shredded and burned and the passenger threatened with hanging unless more money was forthcoming.</p>\n<p>An Australian government source said their plight was “indicative of the money grubbing attitudes of people smugglers who see their cargo as little more than cattle”.</p>\n<p>However, successive Australia governments have also been criticized for what many see as an unfair and harsh stand against illegal immigrants with the opening of the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea and further camps in Nauru as an alternative to the usual route into Australia via Christmas Island off the north east coast.</p>\n<p>As a result people smugglers are being confronted by passengers angered at being told Australia was not an option, they don’t want to go to PNG or Nauru – which rank among the world’s least developed countries – and would prefer their money back and a ticket home.</p>\n<p>“The smugglers really are coming under intense financial pressure. They are refusing to refund fees to passengers that no longer want to make the trip and unless they are genuine asylum seekers as opposed to an economic refugee, they are not interested in PNG or Nauru,” the Australian government source said.</p>\n<p>On Manus Island illegal immigrants and asylum seekers can apply for residency through United Nations programs to a third country but Australia is no longer an option. This process is made harder because PNG does not have a processing system to determine asylum seeker claims.</p>\n<p>People diverted to Manus island or Nauru are being left in a legal limbo and in the interim life is harsh.  The UN High Commission for Refugees says the facilities on PNG fail to meet international protection standards and common complaints include extremely hot and humid conditions and a shortage of clean drinking water.</p>\n<p>Sources from non-governmental organizations (NGOGs) said the facility had been described as dog kennel by those who worked there adding that reports of rape had been received, including one Pakistani man who was raped by six inmates.</p>\n<p>“The people who run the detention centre know what is happening,” one source said. “But the victim and perpetrators are still housed in the same area because there is nowhere else to put them.”</p>\n<p>About 600 people have been stopped from getting on boats in Indonesia since the conservative Liberal Party was elected in Australia on September 7 and Operation Sovereign Borders introduced. Tony Negus, Australian Federal Police (AFP) chief commissioner hailed the success saying it was the result of the cooperative relationship with other agencies in Australia and the Indonesian National Police.</p>\n<p>However that relationship with Jakarta has also been sorely tested.</p>\n<p>Australia took about 60 asylum seekers last week after they were refused entry to Indonesia, causing a diplomatic row between the two neighbors. They will be taken to Christmas Island and then onto Manus Island or Nauru.</p>\n<p>“In the best interests of the safety of the passengers and crew,” Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said, “earlier this morning I requested transfer of the persons rescued to Christmas Island for rapid onward transfer to Manus Island or Nauru.”</p>\n<p>“They will not be resettled in Australia,” he said.</p>\n<p>That message has only added to the existing complications of life onboard the boats. Busted promises of political asylum in a first world country and a failure to deliver have resulted in wild scenes. In mid-September a brawl erupted in Cisarua on Java after the Syrian smuggler Abu Vasim refused to hand back money to two groups of Iranians after an illegal crossing to Australia went awry.</p>\n<p>An academic report undertaken at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul documented similar stories with Afghan emigrants told to lie and make up cover stories to justify false claims for political asylum in Europe, Canada, or Australia.</p>\n<p>Typically passengers would initially travel on legally obtained Afghan passports into transit countries like the United Arab Emirates. Here they were met by agents who provide fake British or European passports with the appropriate visas.</p>\n<p>“As you know anybody who immigrates, to get citizenship they make a fake scenario to show that their life is in risk in their own country or they have some social problems that makes it difficult for them to live in their own country,” one failed Afghan asylum seeker was quoted as saying.</p>\n<p>A subsequent story was fabricated that the father of a refugee had fought the Taliban and was captured and killed, his body sent back with a message the son would also die.</p>\n<p>His family escaped and moved into their grandfather’s house in Kabul where life was getting back to normal when the Taliban discovered and resumed harassing them. It become too much once a grenade was thrown into their home.</p>\n<p>The report quoted the asylum seeker as saying he raised US$20,000 with the support of his grandfather and he boarded a flight for Dubai with an Afghan passport and a UAE visa and a fake British passport hidden in his overnight bag. But their plans fell apart when an airline official insisted that the intended carry-on luggage be checked-in.</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of genuine refugees in need of political asylum from Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East. More than two million refugees have fled Syria for neighboring countries and they could herald the next big wave illegal immigrants in search of safer shores.</p>\n<p>However, their choices are being whittled back by get tough immigration policies in the west, increased costs and a crackdown on people smugglers by international authorities. The tragedy being that boat people with genuine grounds for asylum have been caught-out and their chances of finding a politically safe harbor is proving harder than ever.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Afghanistan and the long road out &#8212; This article first appeared in The Edge Review By LUKE HUNT / Kabul People smugglers are feeling the pinch.

Weighty issues of state like the Khmer Rouge tribunal in Cambodia are more his fare and stand in stark contrast to the drug smuggling days of the 1960s, 70s and 80s that feature in his latest book, <i>Thai Stick – Surfers, Scammers and the Untold Story of the Marijuana Trade</i>.</p>\n<p>That business thrived on the antics of young surfers from California, Hawaii, Australia and elsewhere &#8212; men and women who dreamed of perfect waves in exotic locations like Bali, access to cheap pot and deep pockets. For many, smuggling would become a way of life, earning them the description from one critic as the “Laurel and Hardy of the high seas.”</p>\n<p>Maguire, an accomplished big wave surfer himself, and his co-author Mike Ritter, an equally accomplished drug smuggler, take the reader on a fantastic joy ride from the innocence of the early Balinese days of smuggling to Thailand, from where enormous quantities of marijuana were shipped across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast of the United States, earning some millions of dollars but also years in jail.</p>\n<p>Many of the scammers got both, but Maguire and Ritter are sympathetic. After all, pot was and is considered relatively harmless and those smuggling the drug were a different breed of dealer to the maniacal Mafia and Mexican drug cartels who would come to dominate the international heroin and cocaine trade of recent decades.</p>\n<p>“Unlike the soldiers on R&amp;R who ate Texas T Bones and flocked to sleazy bars like the Sandbox and the Fantasy Club, the scammers preferred to eat noodles and drink at the outdoor food stalls,” they write of those who hung out in Pattaya. They were “an unlikely mix of hippies and Vietnam veterans who shared little more than the fact the Vietnam War was the defining event of their lives. For scammers, the draft had turned many into fugitives, and for career soldiers, Southeast Asia felt a lot more like home than America.</p>\n<p>“Once word got out that it was easy to score Thai sticks in Pattaya, a Thailand-Bali axis began to emerge, and no group was better represented than the surfer scammers.”</p>\n<p>Initially, surfboards were hollowed out and suitcases built with false bottoms that were then stuffed with hash. Crates of the stuff were sent home by grunts through the US Post Office. As Thai sticks – seedless buds of high grade marijuana rolled and tied in sticks – emerged, so too did an array of characters lining up to handle trans-Pacific sales. Among them were the hippies from the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, who used profits from sales of Thai sticks to support the free distribution of acid across America.</p>\n<p>“The Brotherhood was a messianic Utopian movement in American history. I would totally contend that they were a religious organization. They took massive amounts of LSD and thought they saw God; it was probably a reflection off the van,” Maguire said. “They could have made a hundred times more money, but they chose to distribute hallucinogens instead.”</p>\n<p>Businesses turned to empires and, as one official from the American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) put it: “I remember it was three million dollars a ton and these guys are bringing over ten tons at a time so you’re talking thirty million dollars. It was staggering in the eighties.”</p>\n<p>One of their biggest fears was the Khmer Rouge, who had taken control of Cambodia, shut it down and turned the entire country into one very big gulag. Michael Deeds and Chris Delance were clean living friends from schooldays in Long Beach, California, allured by promises of adventure in the Far East. Their scam went wrong when their boat sailed off course and they were arrested and taken to the dreaded S-21 torture and extermination camp in Phnom Penh, where they perished only weeks before Pol Pot was ousted by an invading Vietnamese army.</p>\n<p>As for the DEA, Thai customs, Interpol, local police and immigration officers, they were simple nuisances to be dealt with and avoided with all the skill of a sharp mariner confronting bad weather.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the authors successfully capture the imagery of idyllic beaches and surfing that makes this a memorable read for those who can remember the era. It also serves notice on the long-running American war on drugs, which would end the classification marijuana as a soft drug and put thousands behind bars and cost billions of taxpayer’s dollars without making a dent on pot sales in America.</p>\n<p>That seems to have changed. One by one, states in America have begun legalizing marijuana, which is also readily available for medical purposes in places like California. The smugglers, who made and lost fortunes along with years spent behind bars, may have had the final say.</p>\n<p>Luke Hunt can be followed on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeanthonyhunt\">@lukeanthonyhunt</a>.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This article first appeared in The Edge Review By Luke Hunt American academic and author Peter Maguire is best known for his work on war crimes and legal issues surrounding conflict.

As Communications Officer for the Extraordinary Chambers for the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC), Lars Olsen is charged with disseminating information and handling perceptions of the proceedings. He spoke with </span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>’s correspondent </span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><b>Luke Hunt</b></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: Your native Norway is a long way from Cambodia. Why did you decide to move here and take-up the position as Communications Officer with the ECCC?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: All over the world people have heard about the killing fields in Cambodia. When you get a chance to participate in a historic justice process, the choice to move far from home is easy.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: What are your earliest memories of the Khmer Rouge, who ruled between April 1975 and January 1979, and what they did to Cambodia?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: I recall hearing Pol Pot’s name mentioned while in primary school, but it was when we were first introduced to world history, at around the age of 14, that I really learned anything about what had happened in Cambodia. The first news report I clearly remember was from when Ieng Sary defected to the government in 1996 – two years before three decades of war finally came to an end.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: The hybrid nature of the court – a mix of Cambodian and United Nations&#8217; judges, lawyers and funding – has been rebuked by different parties who&#8217;d rather see one or the other running the tribunal. Why was the hybrid formula introduced?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: Unlike other tribunals created through international intervention, the UN involvement in the ECCC process was initiated by a request from the Cambodian government. The United Nations initially proposed to create an international tribunal modeled similarly on tribunals in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, but there was no international consensus for this, and the idea was strongly rejected by the Cambodian government. The hybrid model was chosen after years of negotiations.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: The process is underway that could result in charges of genocide for the most senior surviving leaders, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, in addition to crimes against humanity for which they are already awaiting a verdict. Other less senior leaders from the regime are also expected to be charged. How many more people can the tribunal realistically prosecute and how long can the ECCC maintain its operations?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: In addition to the five persons already indicted, two additional cases with a handful of suspects are currently under investigation, and this can potentially lead to additional trials. The co-prosecutors have said they do not intend to initiate further cases. The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon informed the General Assembly late last year that the i</span></span><span>ndicative court schedule projects judicial activity until 2018, and possibly beyond.</span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: The tribunal has already cost more than US$200 million. Some say that is a lot of money, others say it is realistic and comparable with costs to build one bridge over the Mekong River or about US$100 for every person killed by the Khmer Rouge. Has it cost too much?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: It is difficult to put a price tag on justice and reconciliation. All experience shows that complex legal proceedings involving multiple suspects accused of crimes against humanity and genocide are resource-intensive. In terms of absolute costs, the ECCC is amongst the least expensive of all of our “sister-tribunals.” Is it worth it? I think we can only assess that once we have completed our mandate.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: The Cambodian government has been slow at times in meeting its financial contribution, forcing the UN to step in with a loan to the ECCC. Have those funding issues been resolved?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: During the last six months, the government has increased its contributions by also covering some of the salaries for the Cambodian staff. This is a positive step forward. There is still a funding shortfall for the national side of the court, but the government is now working closely together United Nations Special Expert David Scheffer to raise additional funds.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: Have you had any personal interactions or chance meetings with any of the defendants that gave you more of an insight into their personalities?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: The interaction with the defendants is strictly regulated, so it is mainly defence teams and support staff who can interact with them during breaks or outside of hearings. So although I have been in the same room with them on many occasions, we have never interacted directly. Sometimes we have received feedback from their lawyers that they have noticed some of the activities of the courts’ press office.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: What has been your favourite moment in court?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: Although there were mixed reactions to the initial 35-year sentence imposed on Kaing Guek Eav, the pronouncement of the first verdict in July 2010 was an emotional moment. The late Reach Sambath, my former chief and friend, had problems hiding his tears during a following press conference when he gave remarks he had prepared together with his daughter. Sambath used to say he was the spokesperson for 1.7 million ghosts, and cried not [out] of disappointment, but of relief. Having lost both his parents and all but one sibling to the regime, he worked his way from selling ice and cigarettes on a street corner in Phnom Penh to become a respected journalist with a degree from Columbia University and then Chief of the Public Affairs Section of the ECCC. Sambath’s tears on that day made me convinced that what we’re doing at the court is important to many survivors.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>What I have found to be among the strongest moments, have been when some of the civil parties have testified about the suffering they endured during the regime. It is impossible not be moved by these testimonies. Also, when the survivors from S-21 during the first trial had a chance to ask questions directly to their former captor, we witnessed something truly unprecedented in modern international criminal justice.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: The ECCC has had more than its fair share of critics, in fact much of that criticism has bordered on hysteria at times. Issues over money and political interference have been chief among them. How much of that criticism is justified? Has there been any political interference in the tribunal process?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: There is no secret that members of the Cambodian government have clearly expressed that they don’t want to see more indictments beyond the five already issued. Such statements are not helpful, and everyone should refrain from making statements that can be perceived as an attempt to influence the proceedings. Regardless of opinions expressed, investigations in two additional cases are ongoing. Parties also have avenues to address any allegation of interference with the judges.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>In fact, some critics have doomed this court since its inception. Despite the doomsday predictions about collapses and never seeing any judgments, we have already completed one case in full, and we are only months away from a judgment in the first trial against Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea. We have already achieved more than what the fiercest critics ever would have expected. But we still have some distance to go before we can cross the finish line.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span><i>The Edge Review</i></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>: How has the tribunal impacted on the lives of ordinary Khmers?</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>Olsen: There is no longer a complete taboo to discuss what happened during this very dark chapter in Cambodia’s recent history. What we experience is that many children for the first time now can ask their parents and grandparents about what they had to endure under the regime. There is no doubt that the court will not be able to fulfill all the high hopes and expectations of the survivors. But hopefully we can contribute to some sense of closure and be a catalyst for reconciliation.</span></span></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span>END</span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>For eight years, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal has attempted to find some kind of justice for those who died under Pol Pot&#8217;s ruthless regime, with some success, and at times fought a difficult battle against <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/the-killing-fields-the-search-for-justice/\" title=\"The Killing Fields &#038;  the Search for Justice\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2014-03-26 12:20:04',8,2,12,'2014-03-26 12:20:04','2014-03-26 12:20:04'),(4068,4068,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TODAY-NOV-21-Nuon-Chea.jpg','Khmer Rouge Tribunal Gears Up for Next Round','khmer-rouge-tribunal-gears-up-for-next-round','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The Trial Chamber at the Khmer Rouge tribunal has outlined its strategy for Case 002/02, which will see additional charges laid against surviving leaders of Pol Pot’s regime, blamed for the deaths of up to 2.2 million people between April 1975 and early 1979.</p>\n<p>Read more from Luke Hunt in <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/khmer-rouge-tribunal-gears-up-for-next-round/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Diplomat</em>.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The Trial Chamber at the Khmer Rouge tribunal has outlined its strategy for Case 002/02, which will see additional charges laid against surviving leaders of Pol Pot’s regime, blamed for the <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/khmer-rouge-tribunal-gears-up-for-next-round/\" title=\"Khmer Rouge Tribunal Gears Up for Next Round\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2014-04-08 17:41:10',8,2,10,'2014-04-08 17:41:10','2014-04-08 17:41:10'),(4071,4071,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ASEAN1-400x301.jpg','Cambodia Leads Doubts Over AEC','cambodia-leads-doubts-over-aec','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; In a rare moment of honesty a Cambodian official has admitted his doubts about his country’s ability to meet regional expectations in time for the launch of the much vaunted ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015.</p>\n<p>Read more from Luke Hunt in <a href=\"http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/cambodia-leads-doubts-over-aec/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Diplomat</em></a>.</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; In a rare moment of honesty a Cambodian official has admitted his doubts about his country’s ability to meet regional expectations in time for the launch of the much vaunted ASEAN <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/cambodia-leads-doubts-over-aec/\" title=\"Cambodia Leads Doubts Over AEC\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2014-04-09 06:12:55',8,2,10,'2014-04-09 06:12:55','2014-04-09 06:12:55'),(4073,4073,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/800px-TOMS_indonesia_smog_lrg-400x300.jpg','Politicians and Corporates Ensure Acrid Haze Returns','politicians-and-corporates-ensure-acrid-haze-returns','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; Each year, about 200 million people across large swathes of Southeast Asia are forced to choke on dreaded smog caused by massive burning off in Indonesia, where the culprits have enjoyed a long-standing impunity.

Massive storm systems over Southeast Queensland hammered the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), devastating coral cover and it has struggled to recover ever since.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But scientists also noticed that the reef&#8217;s ability to rehabilitate itself was beinghampered by dredging and harmful farming practices with excess nutrients in the water leading to coral bleaching and encouraging the reef&#8217;s biggest threat, the coral-eating crown of thorns star fish, to breed in uncontrollable numbers.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Then plans for a major expansion of the port facilities at Gladstone to handle increased coal exports upset environmentalists advocating an end to the industry. Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)launched a campaign to have the GBR listed as endangered by UNESCO.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">While damage to the reef might be unprecedented it is restricted to the southern end of the marine park, which was punished by a very rare cluster of cyclones in the first decade of this century.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">“The reef is in far better condition than the conservation movement would have you believe,” said Col McKenzie, Executive Director of the Association of Marine Park Tourism operators.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">“The conservation movement seems determined to stop the export of coal and has seized on the dredging and port development issues to advance their agenda while they effectively generate negative publicity that is convincing long haul flight tourists not to visit the GBR.”</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A public outcry over damage to the reef also prompted the Australian government to act.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Through <i>Th</i><i>e Reef 2050 Long Term Sustainability Pla</i><i>n </i>the release of inorganic nitrogen by farmers will be cut by 80 per cent by 2025, natural wetlands are to be revived while capital dredging has been abolished along with the dumping of spoil within the GBR Marine Park.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It also includes a A$2 billion, 10-year plan to improve water quality and ensure the reef&#8217;s future, which operators hope will help counter much of the negative publicity surrounding the marine park.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">&#8220;As the GBR is 2,300 km area and has the area of Japan or Italy, it is extremely rare to have a cyclone effect a large percentage of the reef,&#8221; McKenzie said. &#8220;Sure some individual areas were affected but too much of the tourism area.&#8221;</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Those tourism areas include Whitehaven Beach in the Whitsundays, a stunning white sand beach where pulling on a stinger suit for protection against the highly venomous Irukandji, a tiny box jelly fish with an excoriating sting, is an awkward introduction to local tropical waters teaming with marine life.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Two people in Australia are believed to have died from Irukandji stings, both in 2002.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Nearby Hamilton Island has been home to the rich and famous – including rock stars like George Harrison. And Qualia Resort has undergone a AUD$350 million upgrade since the island was acquired by Bob Oatley, the founder of Rosemount Estates, in 2003 for just AUD$200 million.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Its lagoons are filled with expensive yachts and lavish lifestyles with nearby upmarket restaurants made for the seriously moneyed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">But if your tastes are geared towards a more natural, rustic destination then Lady Elliot island is a trip. A tiny outpost and basic eco-resort at the southern most end of the reef with access restricted to twin props on a runway of native grass, Lady Elliot is also proof of the reef&#8217;s ability to regenerate.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Swimming with turtles over shallow reefs, giant coral trout, reef sharks and deep dives for the experienced snorkelers among manta-rays are just a few minutes from shore. Glass bottom boats operated by knowledgeable and friendly staff who deploy visiting snorklers to collect information on marine life seen on the reef, adds a sense of purpose to the experience.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Russell Reichelt, Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GRMPA) said Lady Elliot island was laid almost bare by Cyclone Hamish five years ago but coral tables almost six metres across had recovered and were now sheltering some of the largest coral trout on the reef.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">“Tourism operators say that sometimes media reports of major cyclones can affect their short term bookings. They imagine that there location has been affected even though the storm may have been occurring 1000kms from where their holiday was planned to be.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">“So perceptions can play a role in tourists&#8217; choices”</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">He said recent dives around Lady Elliot were comparable with his first experiences on the reef in 1968.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">“Yet Lady Elliot Island and reef are at the southern end of the Reef which scientific surveys suggest is under most pressure from storm damage,” he said.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Direct flights from most major Southeast Asian cities, including Singapore Airlines and Qantas, to Brisbane are daily and Hamilton and Lady Elliot islands are a short hop by charter flight.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Getting there is also getting easier. Townsville airport, towards the centre of the GBR, is being expanded to handle international traffic.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><i>Luke Hunt toured the Great Bar</i><i>r</i><i>ier </i><i>R</i><i>eef as part of the Australian government&#8217;s International Media Visits (IMV) program.</i></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>This story first appeared in The Edge Review By LUKE HUNT / Lady Elliot Island Australia&#8217;s reputation as the Lucky Country blessed by sunshine and idyllic beaches has taken a cyclonic beating over recent years. <a class=\"mh-excerpt-more\" href=\"https://bomborra.asia/putting-the-great-back-into-a-reef/\" title=\"Putting the &#8216;great&#8217; back into a reef\">[&#8230;]</a></p>\n</div>','2015-04-29 16:02:41',8,2,12,'2015-04-29 16:02:41','2015-04-29 16:07:43'),(4482,4482,'https://bomborra.asia/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2ef091e93a9bd58eb7afb66c3e76703e_jokowi.jpg','It’s Time ASEAN Took a Good Look at Its Gallows','its-time-asean-took-a-good-look-at-its-gallows','<p>FAR EAST CORRESPONDENT &#8212; The blowback over Indonesia’s latest decision to execute foreigners – including a four Nigerians,  two Australians, and a Brazilian – will taint the presidency of Joko Widodo and cast a dim light over his factional rival Megawati Sukarnoputri, chair of the ruling PDI-P.</p>\n<p>The pair are not on good terms, with speculation of a power struggle, and Megawati is prone to reminding Widodo that she is in charge.

That ban has upset human rights activists and been opposed by opposition parties and civil groups as simply unfair.</p>\n<p>Australia is also negotiating 20-year visas with Nauru on behalf of those who will remain behind after refusing resettlement offers or declining to return home after their claims were rejected.</p>\n<p>Once cleared, the Manus Island processing center will close; however, Nauru was expected to remain open and will handle any further arrivals although the Australian government is dropping all financial support for the center as part of broader government spending cuts.</p>\n<p><strong>In Indonesia, Asylum Seekers Sit Tight</strong></p>\n<p>Australia’s military deployment came as Indonesia’s senior police commissioner for human trafficking, Sulistiono, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/indonesia-warning-over-us-asylumseeker-deal/news-story/7b9be69e96229f9c70ef990591562b01\" target=\"_blank\">warned the deal</a>could provide “a breath of fresh air” for people smugglers who were effectively run out of business by Australia’s tough stand on asylum seekers arriving by boat.</p>\n<p>But according to those waiting to be processed in Indonesia, the resettlement deal changes nothing and they insist the days of maritime travel to Australia, for them, are over.</p>\n<p>Fears of people smugglers have intensified with the deaths of more than 7,000 people amid attempts to cross the Mediterranean Sea over the past two years from the strife-torn Middle East.

Viva Hurley!<br><br></div><div>By Michael Hayes<br>&nbsp;One of Phnom Penh’s most legendary venues closes tonight.<br>&nbsp;Cantina, the restaurant cum watering hole and brainchild of Hurley Scroggins III, will shut its creaky, iron gate on the riverside late tonight for the last time—probably after midnight–and end a memorable and historic chapter in the life of this fair city.</div><div>What Hurley created and ran for more than a decade was a noble nexus for all of us, his pals, the poobahs of the local media scene, the wannabes, the ex-pat parachutists trying to get up to speed on the latest goss, the development dons parsing stakeholder issues, the confused whackos we’d politely avoid, and a whole slew of denizens who would ask each other during the day “Where you want to meet tonight? Okay, see you at Hurley’s.”</div><div>Why did we say that? For me it was simple because if the other guy didn’t show up, I knew I could just hang with Hurley and that would be more than sufficient. In fact, it would be, as I know so well from the countless times I parked my weary elbows on his bar, like a small slice of bliss. We’d chat, catch up on the day’s events, surf the unknown and too well-known universe of weird stuff, exchange potential scoops, and just enjoy each other’s witty perspectives on almost everything.<br>&nbsp;Hurley helped all of us cope. His humor is righteous, clever and infective. He has been the master of ceremonies, the gracious host, the humble and insightful observer, and as the French would say un homme absolument genial.</div><div>We’ve known each other for so long, since back during UNTAC in 1992 when we first met, that we can have conversations where one word can sum up a decade and then we can move on to the heart of the matter without needing to go into the old drama of small details. We can skateboard over the big picture and then move onto the now in a minute. How fun is that!<br>&nbsp;Hurley used to work for the Phnom Penh Post and he was one of the best writers the paper ever had. Journalism schools say you have to develop your own voice. Hurley didn’t need to be told that. His voice radiated regularly like a nova. Reading his copy was like drinking funny silk tea. Every sip went down smoothly with a wry chuckle. Would that the Post had more writers like Hurley.</div><div>One of the best stories he wrote, way back during the Ieng Sary defection days, I framed and gave it to him as a gift. He hid it upstairs, saying “Oh no, people will say I’m trying to tip my own hat.” Such a humble guy. I tip my hat off to him for the great copy he contributed to the Post (and encourage him to write more while he sorts out his next move).<br>&nbsp;Starting Cantina was for Hurley a leap into the unknown. I remember him talking about it, sitting outside Happy Herbs and running up a hefty tab, for what seemed like an eternity. He had plans, was mulling over possible menu items, and everyone was wondering if he could pull it off.</div><div>He did more than that. He developed a place that ended up being one of the most famous and well known venues in Phnom Penh, a meeting point for the local journalism movers and so-called shakers, a haven for quality discussion, a rendezvous for old mates, a place to kick back and assess the state of the universe, and a bar where we all knew Hurley would be there to add his wit and hospitality to the mix.<br>&nbsp;If it weren’t for Hurley we wouldn’t have gone there. And if it weren’t for Hurley it wouldn’t have happened.</div><div>On behalf of the multitude of your friends and admirers here in Cambodia and all over the world, I say: Thank you brother.<br>&nbsp;By the way, the entire planet is invited to come to Cantina tonight to salute Mr. Scroggins, an American icon, for his remarkable achievement and toast him for his efforts.

In Melbourne, considered among the world&#8217;s most liveable cities, Dumpster Diving through the bins of supermarkets to salvage what&#8217;s left is now common.</em></p>\n<p>By Morgan Reinwald</p>\n<p>Spiralling through the grime-filled alleyways of central Melbourne is a repugnant experience. Trenching between two tired concrete structures stained with rebel graffiti, the combination of litter and human faeces form a stench that is abominable.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the notion of garbage is appropriating a wide range of goods and nutrition that appear no different to shelf-bought items. Nonetheless, many of Australia’s biggest food and retail companies are throwing away items every day that are perfect for consumer’s consumption. Hence, the trend known as ‘dumpster diving’ is gaining notorious popularity; the act of searching through the dumpsters of a shopping centre as a spontaneous way to receive one’s grocery shopping or any other item for free.</p>\n<p>I take each step forward with precaution, constantly looking back every few feet to hear the busy sounds of Melbourne’s hustle become fuzzier and clouded, until there is nothing left. Silence. The air-conditioning units stacked on one another up the building’s wall lead to a small opening at the top which enables the slither of light left in the day to be glimmered in among the darkness. I look straight ahead at two dumpsters, one yellow and one blue, hidden within the shadows at the end of this alleyway.</p>\n<p>This hidden corner of the city is where I begin my search through what most people would call trash, while others, would honourably signify it as dinner. Unsure of who the bin belongs to I lift the lid which simultaneously opens a floodgate to a swarm of flies. As this happens I’m immediately hit with a startling wave from the dump’s vile odour. These first impressions make me step back so I can rid myself from squirming. Standing briefly, looking at what’s in front of me I contemplate: how could anyone eat this vulgar? Dare I say it contains edible food. Of course, there was only one way to find the solution to that question.</p>\n<p>I reapproached the bin with a guarded sense of nature. My arms, acting as a magnet for the flies, delicately weave in and out of the bin’s contents. Although, this wary approach of selecting what I touched only allowed me to scratch the surface of the five-foot-deep container, and thus, it dawned upon me that I had to dig deep into the unknown if I were to have any success of finding something valuable.</p>\n<p>Immersing my whole upper body into the bin, I feel a square cardboard box that I presume to be food packaging. Although, it’s slimy and wet, minimizing my hopes of success. The result was in fact a box of Frosty Bites ice cream, untouched and in perfect condition.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, they were completely melted and deemed inedible.</p>\n<p>Going back in for a second dive, however, led me to finding a white styrofoam box which was labelled ‘Salmon – 6.7kg’. Sure enough though when I opened it up, a foul stench of rotten fish oozed out of the box that made my stomach feel like jelly, leading my experience to the disappointing conclusion that dumpster diving isn’t as pleasant as its online following claims it to be.</p>\n<p>Feeling unassured of this endeavour I turned to a group of dumpster enthusiasts on Facebook, a page specifically for those who live in Melbourne. It was here that I engaged with people who like to refer to themselves as ‘Freegans’ &#8211; ‘a type of person whorejects consumerism and seeks to help the environment by reducing waste, especially by retrieving and using discarded food and other goods’.</p>\n<p>It was here that a Freegan told me that he gets all his fruits and vegetables from the exact same bin every night between four and five o’clock, while another person spoke about hisadventures that have taken him to abandoned buildings where he has found disused, functional TVs. Most divers do, however, prefer to act anonymously because of the illegality of searching through another’s bin.</p>\n<p>Gathering inspiration once again from this online advocacy for dumpster diving, I looked into Australia’s food statistics. Astonishingly, 3.6 million people in Australia experience food insecurity each year, with 27% of this figure being made up of children. Emphasizing this heartbreak is the $9 billion worth of consumer food that is being thrown out every 365 days.</p>\n<p>Motivated to continue yet irritated at the same time, my adventure persevered, calling out to those with any sort of association to this activity. Luckily, I connected with a friend of mine who works at the local bakery in my neighbourhood. I will call her Sarah for the purposes of her employment security.</p>\n<p>Unfathomed why so much food is thrown out, she told me that because their bread is baked fresh daily, anything that doesn’t sell must be chucked away at the end of every working day. Wanting to witness first-hand the amount of actual wastage, she told me to meet her behind the carpark of the shopping centre &#8211; “Thursday night we close at 6:30… come around then and see or yourself”. Little did I know in that moment was the shock I would witness beyond my belief.</p>\n<p>I arrive 10 minutes early to the agreed upon time and wait in my car across the other side of the road. My hands are sweaty. I lift them from the position on the steering wheel and can see a damp outline of where they had been resting. I look in the rear-view mirror to check my surroundings to see the odd person walk by with their late night shopping. My stomach churns as I get out of the car and cross the road. Unlike the dumpsters in Melbourne these bins are in the open for onlookers to see. A turn of the head from someone who didn’t like what I was doing, and I could be in some serious trouble. The consequences are minimal but the momentary embarrassment, unbearable. I struggle to act normal and pretend to talk to someone on my phone, holding it next to my ear in hope that a passer-by wouldn’t link me with such an illegal endeavour. Unknown to anybody in that moment was that on the inside I was clenching my teeth and squeezing the sweat from my hands with a tight fist in my pocket, constantly observing everyone behind my dark sunglasses.</p>\n<p>Upon the arrival of my source I take note of the thick lines from her forehead being prominent due to exhaustion, her eyelids half closed, too fatigued to keep them open.  She is carrying 2 black garbage bags, one in either hand. Their immense size make her walk awkwardly as they sway side to side, jostling her legs with every step. I feel for her and offer to help, though she kindly refuses, “I could get in big trouble if I’m caught (helping you)”. Evident that the bags are full of bread I ask why it isn’t just donated. She tells me that a guy comes every night and takes some of the bread to the dog shelter, though it’s only the loaves and rolls. Anything sweet or containing dairy must be thrown out.</p>\n<p>When she’s done, I walk back with her to the door and give thanks for answering my questions before hastily pacing myself over to the bin again. Using the long nails of my two index fingers I slit the garbage bag open. I’m stunned. Unlike the bags I cut open in the city, there is no foul odour released, no slime wriggling its way under my nails. Instead, staring back at me is the baked goods that could have been purchased in store twenty minutes prior. I propel through mounds of bread and pick out a bag of six wrapped hot-cross buns, choc-chip flavoured with a warm golden colour. After inspecting its glamorous quality, I throw them back into the bin with a sad sense of disrespect, a quality that so much food is treated with. The other bag displays identical results.</p>\n<p>This perfect nourishment would have been fit to feed the five thousand, even more so, the 3.6 million Australians who are experiencing food insecurity this year.</p>\n<p>Reflecting upon my experience of the garbage in the inner city through to the trash of regional Victoria, my understanding has led me to the realisation that Australia has a major problem with its approach to the management of food, where it goes, the consumers who waste it and those who go hungry every night. And so, it is the small act of dumpster diving that will hopefully ignite the fire in changing Australia’s future attitude.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n',0,'<div class=\"mh-excerpt\"><p>Homeless and poverty is an increasing issue in affluent Australia.
